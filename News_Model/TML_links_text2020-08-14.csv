(Photo by Andre Ringuette/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images) In one week, the   provided numerous highs and lows for fans. When you look back at the series and season that was, inconsistency is a word that fits. After losing Game 1, the Leafs stormed back and played one of their most complete games of the season in Game 2. John Tavares put the team on his back and showed why he was worthy of the captaincy, while Auston Matthews also shined. It was a full-team effort and a bounce-back game that was needed to keep their season alive. Midway through Game 3, it felt like the Leafs had taken a stranglehold on the series and would finish it off in Game 4. But then, like many years before, they blew a huge lead and our hearts sank. Toronto Maple Leafs 20"" 8-Wheel Hardcase Spinner Carry-On - Black It was such a defeating loss and begged us to ask the question as to why we cheer for the Leafs in the first place. As Game 4 approached, the hope of another bounce-back was in our minds, but at the same time, the season seemed finished. How do you blow a 3-0 lead and lose? After finding themselves in the same situation with four minutes left in Game 4, the Leafs did the unthinkable. They tied the game to force overtime and in the extra-frame, Matthews sealed the win. Game 5 was now do-or-die and the momentum felt in Toronto’s favor. When you make a huge comeback like they did in Game 4, it’s impossible to lose Game 5, but in classic Leafs form, they found a way. The Blue-and-White were shutout once again and the series ended. The roller-coaster ride of emotions was finally finished and the Leafs had officially been eliminated. With the season in the rear-view mirror, the Leafs organization held their year-end press conference on Wednesday and here are three key takeaways from it.

It’s that time of the season when speculations and conversations about what the team should do become constant conversations between Maple Leafs fans and hockey commentators. In this edition of Maple Leafs News & Rumors, I’ll pass along some of the rumors I’ve been hearing as well as offering news about the players within the organization. Although the team’s been ousted from postseason play, there’s news to share. John Scott, who played one game for the Montreal Canadiens in 2015-16, had some interesting stats during his NHL career. In total, he played 286 games over nine seasons with seven different teams (Minnesota Wild, Chicago Blackhawks, New York Rangers, Buffalo Sabres, San Jose Sharks, Arizona Coyotes, and the Canadiens). In those 286 games, he scored five goals and six assists for 11 points. However, he also had 544 penalty minutes. He was, if you haven’t guessed, an enforcer.  Today Scott does a regular podcast every Wednesday and Friday titled “Dropping the Gloves,” which can be insightful – especially some of his NHL stories. Two days ago he tweeted a radical idea about a Maple Leafs and Canadiens trade possibility. The   need to switch things up… what do you think of this: To MTL: John Tavares To TOR: Shea Weber, Brendan Gallagher Thoughts? — John Scott (@johnscott_32)  In this trade, the Maple Leafs would send captain John Tavares to the Canadiens for their captain Shea Weber and forward Brendan Gallagher. Both teams would get a top-six center and the Maple Leafs would get their shutdown defenseman. Shea Weber, Montreal Canadiens ( /The Hockey Writers) I have three thoughts about this trade. First, it’s a true blockbuster that Maple Leafs fans would talk about for years. Second, it’s really quite clever and not altogether crazy. Third, it won’t happen. First, Tavares would have to approve the trade because he has a full no-movement clause in his contract. Second, Tavares signed with Toronto because he was coming home. He’s the little boy who slept in a bedroom designed with Maple Leafs blue and white. Third, Tavares has a bit of a “dig-in” streak in him. He must be chafing with all the criticism of “his” team, and given this was his first season as captain, I bet he truly sees the Maple Leafs as “his” team. He’ll stay with this ship until it sinks or the lifeboats come. But think of it: just watching Weber play during this postseason shows he’s one of the best NHL defensemen currently playing the game. Maybe even Morgan Reilly isn’t as good. And, Gallagher’s a great and deeply motivated hockey player. He might even be the heart and soul of the Habs. Plus, he’s a regular 30-goal scorer. John Tavares, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) Salary wise, the trade would almost be a wash. Tavares’ salary cap taps out at $11 million, and Gallagher has another season at $3.75 million, with Weber at $7.875 million for the next six seasons. Only the 35-year-old Weber’s age is an issue. In an occurrence that’s happening more often recently with the anticipated later starts of hockey leagues in North America for the 2020-21 seasons, the Maple Maple Leafs loaned another player to a European team. This time Jesper Lindgren was loaned to Modo of the Swedish Hockey League. Lindgren spent the 2019-20 season with the Maple Leafs AHL affiliate Toronto Marlies, scoring 9 points in 31 games. The 23-year-old defenseman will likely be recalled before the AHL’s next season begins. However, as noted, no one knows right now when that might be, so, why not let these prospects play? Maple Leafs’ PR also tweeted on Wednesday that the organization had loaned Filip Kral to HC Prerov of Czech Second National Hockey League. The 20-year-old left-shooting defenseman had played the 2019-20 season with the WHL’s Spokane Chiefs, scoring 12 goals and 49 points in 53 games. The   have loaned defenceman Filip Kral to HC Prerov (Czech) and defenceman Jesper Lindgren to Modo (SHL). — Leafs PR (@LeafsPR)  Kral was a fifth-round choice (149th overall) in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft and he’s probably a few seasons away from trying to crack the Maple Leafs roster. The news on Tyson Barrie is that he’s feeling better. Barrie, whose injury was listed as “undisclosed,” was clearly dealing with concussion-like symptoms after  “I banged my head on the ice pretty hard and had some headaches. They’re pretty careful with the concussion stuff. Thankfully I’m feeling pretty good right now but I had to take care of it.” Tyson Barrie, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) Now that the Maple Leafs have been knocked out of the postseason, rumors see Barrie moving on. He’s unsigned for next season and needs a new contract somewhere. Although Barrie didn’t play to his usual standards this season, he’s sure to have choices about where he plays. It was his first down season after three straight seasons scoring 50 points. With Colorado, he quarterbacked the Avalanche’s first power-play unit. It’s likely that, if the 28-year-old defenseman could get similar work with another team, he’d probably put up the bigger numbers he was used to before moving to Toronto. Who knows what the Maple Leafs might have done had Jake Muzzin stayed in the lineup? Muzzin’s injury might have been the straw that broke the team’s back during their best-of-five series against the Blue Jackets. He’s that important to the team. During Game 2, Muzzin was crosschecked (not that hard actually), lost his balance, fell awkwardly, and hit his head on Oliver Bjorkstrand’s knee. He missed the remainder of the qualifying series. His injury was freaky-scary for everyone, but I’m sure his family must have been freaking out when he was stretchered off the ice. Jake Muzzin, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) The good news is he’ll be ready for 2020-21, whenever the season might start. When asked about his injury Wednesday, Muzzin reported that it was “kind of a freak play, an accident. All things are looking towards a full, healthy recovery.” Jake Muzzin on his health post injury vs.  : ""I'm feeling good. Kind of a freak play and accident. All things are looking towards a full, healthy recovery."" — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)  When next season starts, it will be interesting to see who his defensive partners might be. Some current teammates will likely be departed. Critics suggest that Dubas has no choice but to trade one of his big four (Tavares, Mitch Marner, Auston Matthews, or William Nylander) for defensive help. I don’t see it. I also don’t think there’s much panic inside the organizational braintrust, which probably panics the Maple Leafs’ faithful. I’m anxious to see what Dubas does as soon as the Zambonis are parked after the playoffs. I think the team’s core will stay pretty intact, but I can’t know for sure. We will all see together.   start:tags     end:tags    start:article footer     end:article footer         Ezoic - BottomNative - native_bottom    placeholder 111 blocked.

""Having a good regular season isn't really cutting it anymore,"" Matthews said Wednesday, three days after Toronto lost its first postseason series for the fourth straight season. ""We have to figure out the playoffs and how to get out of the first round. Four years in a row is obviously pretty frustrating and pretty embarrassing as well with the talent we have on this team that we haven't been able to pull through."" The Maple Leafs, the No. 8 seed in their best-of-5 Stanley Cup Qualifiers series against the No. 9-seeded Columbus Blue Jackets, were eliminated with a 3-0 loss in Game 5 on Sunday in Toronto, the Eastern Conference hub city, and failed to advance to the Stanley Cup Playoffs. It was the third straight season the Maple Leafs lost a series that went the limit. They lost Game 7 to the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference First Round in 2018 and 2019 after losing in six games to the Washington Capitals in the first round in 2017. ""We in some ways have taken a step back (in the past two years), but we are determined, in spite of that, to take more steps forward,"" president Brendan Shanahan said. ""I have complete faith in Kyle [Dubas] as a [general manager] and Sheldon [Keefe] as a coach and complete confidence in what we are going to do here in Toronto. ""I think our potential for growth is even greater than it was a couple of years ago. I'm confident we are going to get it done, you just have to go to work."" Shanahan said things feel different throughout the organization after this series loss. ""Different than the past couple years where this team has been coming together, I sense that the players are extremely angry with themselves and we (management) are angry with ourselves,"" Shanahan said. ""The [players] have higher expectations and these guys really want to win, really want to become the team they are capable of becoming. I really believe that about them and they're not making excuses. We will all look for solutions, but this is not a team that is making excuses right now. The blame lays on us."" Effort and mental toughness are areas that must be addressed, according to defenseman  , who was traded to the Maple Leafs from the Los Angeles Kings on Jan. 28, 2019. Muzzin won the Stanley Cup with the Kings in 2014. ""This group needs to dig in more,"" Muzzin said. ""Yeah, we have lots of skill, talent and speed, but when it comes to playoff hockey, the will to win has to burn a little hotter compared to the other stuff. Once we find that, then we'll be dangerous."" Muzzin missed the final three games against Columbus after being injured in Game 2. He was taken off the ice on a stretcher, but he skated Sunday and said Wednesday he will be ready for the start of next season. As part of the NHL Return to Play Plan, a team is not permitted to disclose player injury or illness information. Matthews insisted that better days are coming soon for the Maple Leafs, who haven't won a postseason series since 2004. ""Our confidence level, it's not feeling high right now, but it should be there,"" said the center, who has played all four of his NHL seasons for Toronto, which selected him No. 1 in the 2016 NHL Draft. ""The perception of how things are going or how the team is being perceived might be a lot different than what we believe in. The results in the playoffs, we haven't shown but with the players we have on this team and our core group being together for four years now, we really believe we are right there. ""We believe in our management, staff and players on this team that we are going to power through this adversity and break through eventually.""   Share this!!

All three can’t wait for November.   For Maple Leafs coach Keefe, the pain and humiliation will linger from losing a qualifying-round playoff series that was there for the taking. But the first eight months of 2020 have already provided 20/20 hindsight, helping him set the table for what will be his first full season behind the bench, starting in late autumn. After waiting for the COVID-19 delayed playoffs to start, Toronto was once more a quick post-season casualty. Its deficiencies against Columbus naturally made people wonder what the coaching staff were doing since March when Keefe and his players prattled on about proving themselves, putting the down time to good use through live chats, pre-scout video, staying in shape, getting back on ice through Phase 2 and eventual full workouts. “We felt that was very productive,” Keefe said this week. “However, you don’t make substantial change through Zoom calls, a two-week training camp and a five-game series. “You make it over a full off-season, full training camp, full exhibition and full regular season. To think you just flip a switch in playoffs and play gritty-style hockey, that’s not reality.” As alternate captain Auston Matthews observed with dry humour in his media exit interview “we have plenty of time before we play meaningful hockey (again).” So why not make the most of that? Though Keefe differs in style from predecessor Mike Babcock, they share the 24/7 dedication to prep work. Don’t expect Keefe to stay away from his office too long. “Am I disappointed in our results? Yes. Am I disappointed we didn’t see enough growth or change? Some of that was probably ambitious on our side. We wanted to do better in that area. But the changes we needed to make within our group are really a mindset that has to happen over the course of this off-season and then from day one of camp. “Given my five years in the organization (with many of his Marlies graduates on this team) I do have a little more knowledge to how that process has worked. There’s room for growth and that’s where I’m looking to push this team. That sets ourselves up for greater consistency in regular season, which fuels our confidence and ultimately, our performance in playoff situations.” Matthews, whose quest for 50 goals ended in March when the NHL shut down, followed by six points against the Blue Jackets, also planned to make it a short break before getting back to conditioning and putting his game face on. The Stanley Cup is projected to be awarded in early October, with a brief off-season before NHL camps begin around Remembrance Day. “I kind of want to get back into it, because all that time off we have, I feel we can make meaningful strides in a lot of different areas,” Matthews said. Of course, the Leafs as a whole will be altered, given inevitable free-agents departing such as Tyson Barrie, possible trades and at least two newcomers challenging at forward — Nick Robertson and former KHLer Alexander Barabanov. Once the roster is more certain, Keefe thinks the cycle of an 82-game season will provide him a better chance to mold the Leafs into the two-way team they had hoped would manidest itself against Columbus. “We (need to show) the confidence of who we are through all of that process,” Keefe said, “to be ready to compete in playoffs; everything from the standings (ideally with home-ice advantage against a low seed) to how we’re playing as a team.” Matthews wouldn’t upstage management with public thoughts on what’s needed to get the Leafs over the top in terms of ‘killer instinct’ or roster changes, leaving that to Keefe and general manager Kyle Dubas. But turning 23 before next camp, he’ll head back to Arizona with one creed. “I know everyone in here believes in each other. Our confidence level isn’t feeling high right now, but it should be there. The perception of maybe how things are going or how the team is perceived outside the locker room might be a lot different than what we believe. “The results in playoffs haven’t shown, but with the players we have and the core group we have, being together four years now, we really believe we’re right there. “I’ll be honest, we don’t really care what other people think or write about all the things we need. I think our management, our staff and this organization, believe. We’ll power through this adversity and break through eventually.” There will be at least one change behind the Leafs bench next season. As previously announced, assistant Paul McFarland is going back to the OHL Kingston Frontenacs as head coach, where he was stationed three years before joining the Florida Panthers and in 2019, the Leafs under Mike Babcock. While the subject of McFarland’s replacement and the return of Dave Hakstol wasn’t broached as the Leafs broke up earlier this week, it could be Sheldon Keefe considers one of his long-time former Marlies staffers, A.J. MacLean or Rob Davison, for McFarland’s post. It would be more likely MacLean, who is the son of former NHLer and coach Paul MacLean. With the European hockey calendar slightly less affected than the NHL’s by COVID-19, the Leafs have loaned defenceman Filip Kral to HC Prerov of the Czech League and defenceman Jesper Lindgren to Modo of Sweden. They join previously loaned forwards Egor Korshkov (KHL Lokimotiv Yaroslavl) and defenceman Mikko Lehtonin (KHL Jokerit) with an eye to them returning sometime before the NHL/AHL regular season and playoffs conclude in late spring 2021.

The qualifying-round loss makes it four straight years Toronto hasn’t advanced in the postseason. ​ But watching that same story unfold again doesn’t appear to have set the stage for an off-season overhaul. Leafs management seems determined to stick with its nucleus for now.  “I have complete faith in Kyle [Dubas] as a general manager, in Sheldon [Keefe] as a coach, and complete confidence in what we're going to do here in Toronto,” said Leafs president Brendan Shanahan on a Zoom call with reporters Wednesday. “We’re determined to get results. It has to do with a mindset; it has to do with some personnel issues. But there are no excuses being made here. It's really about finding solutions, so that we get over that hump. We really do believe that the core guys certainly want to make those changes."" That was the clear message from all 10 Leafs players who spoke on Wednesday, now three days removed from Columbus sending them packing in a 3-0 Game 5 defeat. It was a fitting bookend to the series, which opened with a 2-0 Blue Jackets win in Game 1. Toronto pitched a shutout of its own to win 3-0 in Game 2, then blew a three-goal lead to lose Game 3 before overcoming a three-goal deficit to win Game 4.  Even with copious amounts of firepower to wield, the Leafs only managed three even-strength goals the entire series - one each from Matthews and Tavares, and one from rookie Nick Robertson. Marner didn’t score once in all five games. Tavares had three points. “I think four years in a row [failing to advance] is obviously pretty frustrating, and a little bit embarrassing as well with the talent we have,” said Matthews, who had a team-leading six points in the qualifying round. “We haven't really been able to pull through. The results in the playoffs haven't shown, but with the core group that we have, we really believe that we're right there. And to be honest, we don't really care what other people think. We believe…that we're going to power through this adversity and we'll break through eventually.” Dubas is keeping a similar faith surrounding the team's core. In the past, he's seen successful teams blossom by being patient, and avoiding rash decisions at the first signs of perceived regression.  “I would love for the progress to be linear. I’d love for us to [have won] the Stanley Cup two years ago, and then win it every year,” he said. “But I think progress never really follows the straight line that you want it to. There are lots of teams that go through significant ups and downs on their way to getting to where they all want to go, and when they know that the [core] has the character and the talent to do it, they try to stick with it and not overreact.” Shanahan noted there's a difference in players this season compared to after other early exits, and that now “they’re extremely angry – angry with themselves.” According to defenceman  , that emotion is what will help Toronto reach another level.  “This group needs to dig in more,” said Muzzin, one of two players on Toronto’s roster to have won a Stanley Cup. “Yeah, we have lots of skill and talent and speed, but when it comes to playoff hockey, the will to win has to burn a little bit hotter compared to the other stuff. Once you find that then you can be dangerous.” The problem is Toronto has been slow on the uptake. Four years ago, a rookie-laden Leafs team that finished 30th overall the season before took Washington to six games in the first round. The next season, Toronto fell again in the opening round, this time to Boston, in seven games. The year after, they had two chances to close out the Bruins and advance to the second round, but dropped Game 6 at home and Game 7 on the road. “It's hard. Playoffs are hard; every game is hard,” said  . “The reason teams win is because they dig in and they're hard to play against, so we just have to find another level and bring consistency to our game. It sucks, and we're building towards being in a position where it's gonna stop sucking."" “It's a little bit [of a] mental [issue], but we're close,” added Muzzin. “Last year we said that, but I believe that this group is capable of winning it all and we're looking forward to doing that. I think we have a lot of guys in there that want to win. And that's the belief I have. The wanting to win is crucial, that drives players, and I believe it's in there.” Dubas has literally banked on Toronto’s current core to keep the team competitive. The NHL is projecting a flat salary cap of $81.5 million for at least the next couple of years, and CapFriendly has the Leafs with $4.591 million in space available for the 2020-21 season.  That doesn’t seem like much for a club that could possibly be replacing   and   on the blueline, and has to re-sign restricted free agents   and Ilya Mikheyev. But Dubas balks at the notion Toronto is in financial trouble, or that he won’t be able to bolster the team’s roster to enhance its key players.  “We're not up against the cap, contrary to everyone's belief,” Dubas said. “I think that the players we've committed the salaries to are all extremely talented, and they all produce, and they're all very young, and they're going to continue to improve and get better. It falls on me to continue to build around that group and roll from there.” With the vote of confidence from Shanahan already in place, Dubas will get to work evaluating the entire organization, from staff to players. There’s no set date yet for when the next NHL season will start, but when that day comes, the Leafs best be ready to deliver. “No one's happy right now. And we shouldn't be,” Muzzin said. “The ultimate goal is to win the Stanley Cup, but when you don't reach your goal, why would you be happy? Guys are frustrated and I hope that burns and stays with us until we get another chance.”           ",2020-08-12 00:00:00

Image description text   TORONTO — Uncle. Enough. It’s time. The   need defencemen. Plural.  And, God bless Rasmus Sandin and Timothy Liljegren, but they need some defencemen who are proven. Yes, that means they might cost more than $700,000. Yes, that means subtracting some cap-allotted dollars from the most expensive forward brigade in the sport. Do you know what the NHL’s top nine defensive teams (by goals allowed per game) in 2019-20 all have in common? They’re all alive and well in the playoffs. The real ones that start Tuesday. That group includes the Columbus Blue Jackets. Do you know what the bottom 10 defensive teams in 2019-20 all have in common? They’re all eliminated. That group includes the Maple Leafs, who lost Sunday’s decisive Game 5 by a score of 3-0.  They were also up 3-0 in a pivotal Game 3 and could not lock it down. We’ve beat this drum before, like on the night Mitch Marner   to give Kyle Dubas’s lottery-bound squad the top three highest-salaried forwards in hockey. But circumstances have changed. First and foremost, Dubas’s hefty financial commitments to John Tavares, Auston Matthews, William Nylander and Marner were all made on the (very reasonable) assumption that the salary cap would not only continue to rise with each passing Canada Day but that it could take a dramatic spike when the next U.S. broadcast deal kicked in. That, of course, is no longer the case. The cap will remain flat until the virus decides otherwise. Second, instead of taking a step forward, the Leafs — as a whole — have stumbled back. More than half the NHL is still bubbled up and battling for the Stanley Cup. They are not. The Nazem Kadri trade, though explainable at the time, was a whiff. When push came to shove, rookie coach Sheldon Keefe took Tyson Barrie off the No. 1 power-play unit and replaced him with Morgan Rielly. Alexander Kerfoot’s third line wasn’t awful, but he and Kasperi Kapanen were both handed nice raises last summer. Neither scored a playoff goal, despite Keefe’s proclamation that he expected production throughout the lineup. During the regular season, Toronto has been one of the most dangerous clubs at even strength that money can buy. The post-season is a different beast. One that has gnawed on this core for four years in a row, no matter who’s behind the bench or how much ice time the stars are handed.  Cap hit of Leafs top line today: $33.53M  Cap hit of all 11 forwards the Blue Jackets dressed today: $34.33 M  — Dimitri Filipovic (@DimFilipovic)  As the buzzer sounded in their hollow home Sunday night and Toronto joined the budget-conscious, punchline Florida Panthers as the only two franchises of the salary-cap era yet to survive a single playoff series, a few snapshots spoke volumes: • A white-knuckle sequence in the D-zone where both Tavares and Matthews were scrambling around without sticks in their hands, trying to get into shot lanes. • Matthews, Marner and Tavares bent over their sticks, gasping for breath after playing 21-plus minutes apiece and still failing to score a  fourth  even-strength goal for Toronto over five games. • A dour Matthews — arguably the series MVP in a losing cause — bluntly saying he didn’t have an answer for the trend he saw in the core’s 0-for-4 performance in elimination series. • And Keefe praising the Blue Jackets’ forwards for being so good. The coach also brought up luck, which is seldom a good look.  “A little more luck, and it might be a different result,” Keefe said, noting his team scored on fewer than two per cent of its shots 5-on-5.  Auston Matthews was the only plus player (+1) for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the series.  — luke fox (@lukefoxjukebox)  Because Dubas built his roster as the counter argument to “defence wins championships,” Keefe spent three months of quarantine and the entirety of reset camp tweaking his system and urging his players to buy into improved own-zone play by all five guys. For the most part, it worked. The Leafs did a decent job keeping Columbus out of the danger areas and shut the Jackets out in Game 2. Yet it came at the expense of their identity, their strength. The roster isn’t balanced, so it has fallen to two coaches and some ill-equipped personnel to mask that imbalance. “I’ll be thinking about this one for a while,” a sombre Keefe said post-game. The Leafs will pack their Louis bags and carry a 5-on-5 goal drought of 182:46 worth of game clock into 2020-21. With no Plan B when the sticks go cold, a desperate Keefe tried to make William Nylander a centre. He bumped one of the game’s best forecheckers, Zach Hyman, to Line 2, and stacked his top line. He threw surprise Andreas Johnsson into the mix, even though the winger hadn’t played since before Valentine’s Day. The coach second-guessed his own decisions and deviated from the centre depth that was supposed to attack in unrelenting waves. That’s what solid, committed defences do to their opponents. They frustrate them. Make ’em blink. “We can’t lose sight of who we are as a team,” Keefe said prior to Game 1, prophetically. “We need to be really good offensively.” Conversely, John Tortorella’s group rolled out a trusted game plan night after night.  No secrets to the recipe: Hard work. Heart. Two good goalies. And plenty of quality defencemen who couldn’t care less about their point totals. “We’re not changing,” Tortorella said of Game 4’s epic collapse. “We pissed it away on a couple of bad plays and just within a couple of minutes, [but] we thought we played a good game. We’re going to go play the same way.” “May the best team win,” Jackets captain Nick Foligno wished pre-game. It did. Not only did Toronto’s regular-season deficiencies on the blueline have Keefe and the Leafs second-guessing their own game plan, but the loss of Jake Muzzin — the club’s best pure defender — for Games 3, 4 and 5 underscored an organizational crisis. If you truly have Stanley Cup expectations, one injured defenceman should not be a critical blow against a middle-of-the-pack opponent. For 2020-21, Dubas has already committed $52 million to NHL forwards. On defence? Just $15 million. That gap has to close. The books need a little balance. The Maple Leafs’ blue line is crying for more depth. It’s time. Enough. Uncle.                                     You can change your selections at any time.

Once a fan of the Maple Leafs and now one of team’s hardest workers, Hyman gets the frustration being felt in the wake of another post-season failure.   “100%, I think it’s warranted, it’s justified,” Hyman said. “This loss is probably the hardest for me. Every year you get a year older, you become more part of the team, you grow up with the team. “There is so much hope and you see a path to being successful and that’s when it’s really frustrating, is when you can envision yourself and our team moving on and making a run. “From a fan point of view, I can see why it’s extremely frustrating.

Asking veteran Zach Hyman to give his No. 11 to Alexis Lafreniere if Toronto wins Monday night’s NHL draft lottery, to make the Rimouski junior star feel right at home.   The sting of defeat would certainly be forgotten if the Leafs logo is the last one revealed on the live telecast, which starts at 6 p.m. Eastern time, locally on Sportsnet. Toronto and seven other qualifying losers in their best-of-five series each have a 12.5% chance of getting top pick, with the 6-foot-1 Lafreniere pulling away with the lead ranking by Central Scouting. The left winger had 35 goals and 77 assists for the Oceanic, was MVP at the world junior championship before capturing the Jean Beliveau Trophy as leading scorer in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, as well as its ‘personality of the year’ and Canadian Hockey League player of the year. “His hockey IQ is at the highest level possible,” Jean-Francois Damphousse, of Central Scouting, told   earlier this year. “He’s not a finesse guy who only relies on his overall skills — he competes, he hits, he finishes checks, and is really entertaining to watch. You can feel it when he’s on the ice. “I wasn’t there when Sidney Crosby played (for Rimouski from 2003-05), but you got that feeling that something special was going to happen every time he was on the ice. Alexis brings that same level of excitement.” Toronto, which selected Auston Matthews first overall in 2016 based on its lottery win after a last-place finish, did not expect to be in this consolation conversation for years to come. But first came the the COVID-19 pandemic that halted the season and derailed the entire June draft plan. In the first of two phases of the lottery, in which the eight qualifying also-rans were included, a place-holding team wound up chosen ahead of the seven that missed the playoffs, with just a 2.5% chance going in. So despite some big names already on their roster, Toronto, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Pittsburgh, the Rangers, Florida, Minnesota and Nashville are in the Lafreniere sweepstakes. Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas will not comment until after the draft and it was too soon for coach Sheldon Keefe on Sunday night to consider the upside of getting a Lafreniere ticket after absorbing the 3-0 loss in Game 5. “I’m not focused on it one bit, but it is the next thing on the calendar for us,” Keefe said. “I’ll be paying attention to it, but thinking about this (defeat) for quite a while.” Toronto traded its 2020 first-round pick and Patrick Marleau to Carolina, but it’s top-10 protected. If the Leafs don’t win the lottery tonight, their pick will revert to the Hurricanes and will be either 13th or 14th. But if the Leafs do win the lottery, the pick becomes an unprotected first-rounder going to Carolina in 2021. This year, the Hurricanes acquired defenceman Brady Skjei from the New York Rangers for a first-round pick — the Rangers will get whichever of the picks is worse, which would be Carolina’s own pick. The lottery winner will become just the 10th team since the draft was created in 1963 to have made a post-season appearance and also get No. 1. The Los Angeles Kings won a separate draw to choose second, Ottawa third, while Detroit, who had the best odds, dropped to fourth. After No. 1 and the other non-playoff teams, the seven remaining qualifying series losers will be positioned nine to 15 in inverse order of their points percentage. Selections 16 to 31 depend on results of the current playoffs. The revamped draft, with no host city because of COVID, is scheduled for Oct. 9-10, a few days after the Stanley Cup final is due to wrap up in Edmonton.

Photo by Jeff Vinnick/NHLI via Getty Images On Wednesday, Kyle Dubas told the media the Leafs are “not up against the cap”. Short of some kind of semantic game playing around what “up against” really means that would rival that time we all argued about the true meaning of elite, this statement is totally false.   Of course, the NHL isn’t in the offseason yet, and there is no salary cap in the playoffs. For the Leafs right now through to when the 2019-2020 season actually ends — projected to be mid October — they can sign new contracts or make trades, but they are subject to the old CBA “tagging” rules on adding new contracts. These rules disappear when this season ends, and a simpler process will replace it. But suffice it to say, trades are rare during the playoffs, but re-signing RFAs or UFAs may begin for the Leafs soon. In between the end of the playoffs and the start of free agency, teams have to issue qualifying offers to unsigned RFAs or those players turn into UFAs on free agent day. That sets up the offseason salary cap calculation that is in effect from that date to the last day of training camp. To understand the offseason salary cap concept, you need to understand the in-season one. Simplified, and assuming no one is on LTIR, the in-season calculation goes like this: Add up all the cap hits of the 23 (or fewer) players on the Active Roster, anyone on IR (which removes them from the 23-man limit, not the salary cap), and any retained salary or other ancillary bits of cap hit like bonuses or un-buriable amounts for players in the minors. That total has to be below the salary cap ceiling. In the offseason, there is no Active Roster or 23-man limit, so the CBA defines a system of cap hits that count towards the cap. Those are: All players on one-way contracts, regardless of where they have played the prior season; all players on two-way contracts, prorated by the number of days in the NHL, the qualifying offers given to all RFAs, prorated or not depending on one-way or two-way status; and then all the rest of the things like retained salary. That total has to be below next season’s cap ceiling plus a 10% cushion.  The new season’s salary cap calculation begins on the last day of training camp when teams are required to submit their 23-man roster.  Some reminders: once free agent day is over, the calculation is done on 2020-2021 contract  amounts. NHL contracts are completely distinct from AHL contracts. Players signed by the Marlies to AHL deals are not considered here. Contract type is  not  determined by where a player plays, so someone who has a full season in the AHL can be on an NHL one-way, NHL two-way or AHL deal.

The tightness comes when the calculation moves into the next season — that part that matters most — and that cushion disappears.  The projected roster is just the core of the team plus some acceptable additions, and the point to be taken from it is not  who  is on there, but that 23 men is over the cap. And, there is no reason to believe that Ilya Mikheyev will be playing at his qualifying offer amount, although Travis Dermott might be.  The Toronto Maple Leafs as currently constituted are up against the cap next year, and everything we learned last offseason about the methods to play with a short roster could apply this year. While Dubas claimed in his media availability that the Leafs have “some space”, that’s only true on a roster of less than 22 men.  To add any player of any quality, someone of similar or greater cap hit has to be removed from this roster.                     Loading comments...     Vox Media logo. ",2020-08-13 13:00:00

Roster Moves In real Maple Leafs news, yesterday the Maple Leafs announced some roster moves—Filip Kral and Jesper Lindgren are both headed to Europe.   announce they have loaned defenceman Filip Kral to HC Prerov (Czech) and defenceman Jesper Lindgren to Modo (SHL) — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)   We already knew about ( ) the Lindgren news. Unlike Lindgren, Kral—a 2018 fifth round pick who signed his ELC in April—is not returning to an old team, having spent the past two years with the Spokane Chiefs. Kral is Czech, and many of the European leagues are planning to start up early in the fall, so it’s not surprising that he’s being loaned out to play in the second-level Czech league while North American hockey is in a questionable uproar.  Hardev covered Kral for the  , and I asked him for his thoughts:  “Kral will likely join the Toronto Marlies when their season starts up (most likely in December). I think this is going to be a really good opportunity for Kral to step into a pro league and get used to playing against Men. He’s a smart defenseman with good movement and a very good passer. I’ve said a lot that confidence is a big aspect of an AHL rookie season, so if he can start the season already warmed up it’ll only help him get up to the speed of the league and into the Leafs system.”  “As for Lindgren, I think he was hoping for an NHL training camp in September so he could build off his good first AHL season. I think he was missing some offensive flair we saw in the the Liiga previously, so hopefully he gets some of that back in the Fall and comes back with another step. He’ll really need it if he wants to contend for a spot in the NHL lineup. On the other side, it took a lot of coercing to get Lindgren to Canada from Finland, I wonder if he just stays there.”  Today’s Games Columbus Blue Jackets @ Tampa Bay Lightning, Game 2 (Lightning lead series 1-0)          3pm ET, NBCSN, SN, TVAS, SUN, FS-O  @  , Game 2 (Golden Knights lead series 1-0)              5:30pm ET, NBCSN, SN360, TVAS, ATTSN-RM, NBCSCH Carolina Hurricanes @  , Game 2 (Bruins lead series 1-0)                                                  8pm ET, NBCSN, CBC, SN, TVAS, NESN, FS-CR  @  , Game 2 (Flames lead series 1-0)                                                       10:30pm ET, NBCSN, CBC, SN, FS-SW ICYMI Everything said today by players and management telegraphs running the same team out for another year.

The     and   have been loaned to HC Prerov and MODO respectively. Both players are defensemen that would be extreme long-shots to make the NHL roster next season, but they could be recalled from these loans to play for the Toronto Marlies of the AHL when the minor league season begins. Kral, 20, saw his CHL career cut short when the season was canceled after posting 49 points in 53 games for the Spokane Chiefs of the WHL. The Czech-born defender played three years for Spokane, developing just outside of the spotlight that was on New Jersey Devils prospect   who was busy winning Defenseman of the Year awards. While Kral doesn’t have that kind of upside, his 120 points in 154 games and strong performances in the World Juniors certainly makes him more interesting than the average fifth-round pick. Lindgren meanwhile played this season for the Marlies, recording nine points in 31 games during his first full season in North America. The 23-year old was a fourth-round selection in 2015 and took his time before coming over, but is also an interesting name to keep an eye on as the Maple Leafs try to find cheap depth for their roster. Lindgren has one year remaining on his entry-level contract and will still be waiver-exempt in 2020-21.

The Pittsburgh Penguins have made sweeping changes to their coaching staff, and in Toronto, Auston Matthews comments on the opinions from fans and media about how the Maple Leafs team is constructed. The Florida Panthers are talking to candidates about the open GM job, and will the trade market open up a bit now that 15 teams are able to make deals?  writes that in a conversation with injured forward Bryan Little, the Winnipeg Jets’ player hasn’t closed the door completely on ever returning to the NHL, but a lot has to happen to make a return possible.  Bryan Little, Winnipeg Jets (  / The Hockey Writers) Little explained that for six weeks after the injury (he took a slap shot to the head) he wasn’t even allowed to pick his young daughter up. He tried to practice but was forced to stop and while he still hopes to play again and is “not shutting the door”, he noted the only way he returns if he’s told there’s no risk to do so. It will be hard to imagine a doctor saying there’s never going to be a risk associated to him playing hockey again and a brain injury is a very serious concern.  The Pittsburgh Penguins  coaching staff with the exception of head coach Mike Sullivan. The team announced on Wednesday that Sergei Gonchar, Jacques Martin and Mark Recchi will not have their contracts renewed and Penguins GM Jim Rutherford released a statement saying: We are in the process of conducting a review of our organization because we have underperformed in the playoffs the last few years. We just thought we needed to change the dynamic of our coaching staff. We have very high standards here in Pittsburgh, and we want to continue competing for Stanley Cups. The message to our fans is that ’We are not rebuilding, we’re re-tooling.’ Rutherford: ""We just thought we needed to change the dynamic of our coaching staff. We have very high standards here in Pittsburgh, and we want to continue competing for Stanley Cups. The message to our fans is that ‘We are not rebuilding, we’re re-tooling.’” — Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins)   and the season’s results, “When teams like ours don’t have good success, changes are inevitable. We have to take responsibility for it – and that starts with me.”  : “This is a difficult day for me, more difficult than you can imagine. I know how hard these guys work. We’ve been through a lot together. These guys are good coaches and they’re my friends… The moment Dale Tallon was officially removed as GM of the Florida Panthers, speculation surrounded Montreal Canadiens Assistant GM Scott Mellanby. Mellanby captained the Panthers for several seasons and   has confirmed the team would like to speak with him about the job.  LeBrun reports that the Panthers received permission from the Canadiens to interview him. Pundits from a number of different outlets are trying to dissect what went wrong for the Toronto Maple Leafs, many of them suggesting that the team isn’t constructed properly and the makeup of the roster needs to change. In one example,   the team has a few problems.  He says their defense isn’t deep enough and the team has too much money committed to the their top four forwards. He notes, “I think philosophically they are committed to a style of play that is conducisive to regular season success but not playoff success.” He adds, “They’ve got to get bigger, they’ve got to get a little rougher, and they have a lot of work to do and not much cash to do it with.” Maple Leafs forward Auston Matthews has responded to the opinions he’s hearing about the team (not just from Burke) and has a message for fans and media.  Auston Matthews, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) : “The perception of how things are going or how the team’s been perceived outside the locker room may be a lot different than what we believe in. Obviously the results of the playoffs and what not haven’t shown. But with the players we have on this team and the core group that we have – being together for four years now – we really believe we are right there. And I gotta be honest, we don’t really care what other people think, or how far away other people think we are, or the article they’re going to write about all the things that we need. I think we believe in our management and in our staff and in the players on this team and in this organization that we’re going to power through this adversity and we’re going to break through eventually.” While Matthews’ response should be commended, these pundits will still argue that when you lose every year in the first round, you need more. The current core and management team is why the results haven’t be there and change is what is needed. While a lot of talk has surrounded Mitch Marner, Burke believes it will be Nylander who moves. He notes, “It’s time for William Nylander to move. He is a cash under cap guy. He’s a good player. I think it’s time to move and get a defenseman for him.” The eight teams eliminated from the play-in rounds are now officially joining the seven teams who were already out as teams who can make trades, should they choose.   TSN Hockey Insider Pierre LeBrun confirmed that the 15 teams can get the process going and with knowledge of what the cap will be next season, there could be some action. But, other teams will wait for all 31 clubs to be free to make moves before pulling the trigger on any deals.

I mean, what in the world could the Maple Leafs need from Nazem Kadri with the talent they have in their lineup already? But it goes far deeper than what he showed on the score sheet and is more of what the Maple Leafs missed in their play-in series with the Columbus Blue Jackets is that little bit of edge. And that’s exactly what Kadri brought to the lineup. While Leafs Nation somewhat celebrated   and his contract to the Colorado Avalanche on July 1, 2019, in exchange for Tyson Barrie and Alex Kerfoot, looking back it raises the question of whether or not the Maple Leafs moved their heart and soul player that day. What hurts the discussion of Kadri’s importance to the team is his history of questionable hits come playoff time. In fact, each of the past two years, Kadri earned suspensions that cost him the rest of the Maple Leafs’ first round series against the Boston Bruins both in 2017-18 and 2018-19. Not only did he miss the remainder of each series, but it left the Maple Leafs without one of the players that brought a physical edge to their game and got under the skin of his opponents. See, like a handful of other players around the league, Kadri plays on the edge. His game straddles the line of what is deemed acceptable and not in the game of hockey, but it makes him a successful player at both ends of the ice. Nazem Kadri was forced to answer a lot of questions in Toronto following some of his questionable hits. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov) Even if it did leave the Maple Leafs shorthanded on a number of occasions, the way he played the game and played hard on each and every play is somewhat irreplaceable without the right pieces in the lineup. While he’s remembered for his hits on Bruins’ Jake DeBrusk and Tommy Wingels in consecutive first-round playoff series, what people forget is that Kadri is a two-time 30-goal scorer who also stopped Connor McDavid to ultimately win the game for the Maple Leafs once upon a time. He’s a two-way player that developed into a legitimate NHL centre. But his   played against him. His salary and questionable plays forced the Maple Leafs to make a decision and ended up leading to the end of his Maple Leafs’ career. Playing on the edge or not, there’s no question that Kadri played with fire, physicality and for the teammates that skated with him. After all, his last suspension in a Maple Leafs’ uniform was in response to a questionable hit on veteran teammate Patrick Marleau. As a teammate though he was more valuable than many gave him credit for – especially against teams like the Bruins and, this year’s opponent, the Columbus Blue Jackets who both play a similar physical game. While the Maple Leafs are a team littered with talent, they sometimes lack in getting under the skin of their opponents and channeling their physical side of the game. Enter Kadri – who over 19 playoff games with the team spanning four seasons averaged almost three hits per game. But it was the intangibles like aggravating the Brad Marchands and Jake DeBrusks of the game that made him so irreplaceable. Kadri always had a way of getting under the skin of his opponents. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Mary Schwalm) Sure, the Maple Leafs added Kyle Clifford to their lineup, but his game differs from Kadri’s in that he isn’t so much of a pest as he is a grinder. Both types of players are needed. Both are valuable in their own way. Regardless, the Maple Leafs are still lacking that get-under-your-skin type of player. The one that can drive opponents nuts and still be a valuable offensive and defensive commodity. Marchand is that type of player for the Bruins. Kadri used to be that type of player for the Maple Leafs. Even now, look what he’s been able to add to the Avalanche during their round robin play. In nearly 20 minutes of ice-time per game, Kadri has four points in three games, including a literal buzzer beater that got his team a win. Three of his points have come on the power play as he’s an asset in front of the net and he has thrown four hits with no penalty minutes over that span. Can a player change? Without a doubt. But even as a player who might’ve taken a step back from that line he teetered on so often, Kadri has been a valuable addition to the Avalanche and a major missing piece for the Maple Leafs on their playoff journey. Either way, the team remains without the right pieces to get over the hump come playoff time with their series against the Blue Jackets just another example of that. A defeat that leaves more questions for Leafs Nation, than answers.   start:tags     end:tags    start:article footer     end:article footer         Ezoic - BottomNative - native_bottom    placeholder 111 blocked.

Please read our   first.       					THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette				   I have a simple message for   fans — take a deep breath. After losing Game 1 of their best-of-five   playoff qualifier 2-0 against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday night, many of Toronto’s fans are already getting themselves in position to abandon ship and call it a series.   Now, on one hand, I can’t blame those fans for thinking that way given this team’s playoff stumbles over the last handful of years. But Game 1 at Scotiabank Arena was a virtual toss-up. Scoreless through two periods, both teams had their opportunities to put the puck in the net, but Toronto’s   and Columbus’ Joonas Korpisalo were very good between the pipes, making 33 and 28 saves, respectively.     🗨️ We have to find a way to break them down, get quality looks, second and third opportunities and finish on some of our chances. 🎥 Today's media mashup |    — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Game 2 will be waged on Tuesday night, and the Maple Leafs are expected to show a little bit more determination and come flying out of the gate, so the first 10 minutes of the hockey game will be vitally important for both teams.    That brings me to the key to this series — the first goal of the game. Scoring the first goal is massive for each team because it plays to their strengths and dictates how the rest of the game will flow.   The Leafs and Jackets each won 24 games when scoring first during the 2019-20 regular season, and wouldn’t you know it, each team lost only five times when they opened the scoring in a game.     If Columbus scores first, they can do what they do best, focus on their defence-first mindset and concentrate on shutting down Toronto’s highly skilled top six forwards.   But a first tally for Toronto would force the Blue Jackets to open up their style and potentially expose themselves defensively to a Maple Leafs’ counter-attack. Game 1 offered up a great chess match over the first two periods and the team that scores first Tuesday night may again end up winning.  is the assistant program, news and senior sports director at Global News Radio 900 CHML.

SPORTSCENTRE Reporter   TSN Toronto reporter Mark Masters checks in daily with news and notes on the Maple Leafs, who practised at Ford Performance Centre on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's Game 3 against the Columbus Blue Jackets. What did Sheldon Keefe learn about   when the 23-year-old was promoted to Toronto's top defence pair in six games right before the season pause? ""Just that he can handle it when called upon,"" the Leafs coach said. With   sidelined for the rest of the qualifying-round series against Columbus, Dermott is being asked to step up again. Coming off shoulder surgery, Dermott started slow in the regular season, but played some of his best hockey in late February and early March after Muzzin broke his finger during a game in Tampa. With   and   also sidelined, Dermott joined good pal and former Marlies teammate   in tangling with top lines.  ""Both guys were taking on greater responsibility,"" recalled Keefe. ""Holl had really been doing it most of the season, taking a big step in terms of his responsibility and his role. Dermott's evolving and taking on more as it comes. It's really been injury situations that's given him more opportunity throughout the entire season and this is no different."" Per the website NaturalStatTrick, Dermott and Holl played together for 297 minutes and 40 seconds at five-on-five in the regular season, making them Toronto's fifth-most common pair. The opposition outscored the Leafs 12-11 in those minutes, but the underlying numbers were positive with the Leafs controlling 50.28 per cent of the shot attempts and 53.46 per cent of the expected goals. At Wednesday’s practice, Dermott once again took Muzzin's spot alongside Holl. ""Every single player is valuable and Muzz certainly is one of the most valuable and important people, but I also believe in our game in particular that everyone is replaceable,"" said Keefe. “We're going to have guys come in and step up and continue rolling as a team."" The Leafs went 7-5-4 with Muzzin out of the lineup during the regular season.   If the Maple Leafs are going to get past Columbus in the play-in series, it will have to be without one of their top defenceman in Jake Muzzin. While Travis Dermott will move up to slot in next to Justin Holl, head coach Sheldon Keefe explains why Martin Marincin is ahead of Rasmus Sandin on the depth chart for the last spot.   --- On Tuesday night,   described Muzzin's contribution to the Leafs as ""unmeasurable."" You can certainly understand why. Muzzin is a big leader off the ice as one of only two Stanley Cup champions on the roster. He consistently logs tough minutes against top lines while also playing on the penalty kill. Muzzin led the team in hits and is the club's most physical presence on the back end. Earlier this season, Keefe referred to Muzzin as the ""conscience"" of the team. ""I don't think you can replace what he does for our team, but I think it's important to have other guys help fill that void,” said defenceman  . ""He really offers a lot, but it's a good opportunity for guys to play more minutes and in different situations and rise to the occasion."" That includes Rielly, who rose to the occasion in Game 2 after he and Ceci got off to a shaky start in the series. ""They moved the puck a lot more efficiently,"" Keefe observed of the pair. ""Morgan, in particular, was really sharp. I think he made some adjustments from Game 1 to Game 2 that really helped that pairing a lot and helped our team as a result. I thought we played a really good team game that really helped everybody."" Rielly played a team-high 24 minutes and 37 seconds on Tuesday and sealed the win with an empty-net goal.   With Jake Muzzin out for the rest of the series against Columbus, the Maple Leafs' defensive depth will be put to the test. TSN Hockey analyst Mike Johnson joins Gino Reda to assess the impact Muzzin's absence will have on Toronto's blueline. --- With Muzzin out,   will draw into the lineup on Thursday. It will be Marinicn's first Stanley Cup playoff game since the 2017 series against the Washington Capitals. The Slovak skated with   on the third pair at Wednesday's practice. ""We think that Marty brings some of the elements that Muzz brings,” Keefe explained. ""In particular, the penalty kill, the size and all those types of things, there are some similarities there in terms of what he can provide us and we think that's important."" The 6-foot-5 Marincin, who won a Calder Cup while playing for Keefe with the Marlies in 2018, suited up in 26 games for the Leafs in the regular season averaging 1:40 of shorthanded ice time per game. ​ Keefe revealed he's considering dressing seven defencemen on Thursday, which means rookie   may make his NHL playoff debut.  The betting here is the Leafs will dress seven defencemen for Game 3 against Columbus. They will use   in some situations, especially PK. And they'll use use   in offensive situations. Don't know which forward will come out of the lineup. — steve simmons (@simmonssteve)  --- Mostly quiet in Game 1, Tavares exploded for eight shots on Tuesday night, including a breakaway goal. How did the Leafs and their captain finally get some rush chances against the stingy Jackets? ""We were just quicker and that's not just necessarily the way we're moving our feet, but I think just our execution and the way we moved the puck,"" Tavares explained in his post game Zoom session. ""I thought the D did a great job of just handling their forecheck, which they [Jackets] do really well, and then I think as forwards we were just in sync reading off each other and doing [a] good job of, when we had to, getting pucks in behind and getting on the inside and first on those races that allowed us to then set up the next couple of plays to break them down and create some opportunities, some more possessions. It's something we have to continue, especially when you expect them to make some adjustments.”  The Captain!   puts the Leafs up by two  — Omar (@TicTacTOmar)  In Game 2, the Leafs didn't just have the skill edge, they seemed to be outworking the Jackets all over the ice. ""I don't think it’s rocket science how we need to play in order to have success,"" said Columbus winger  . ""I think we saw that last game with just our effort and our energy level, it wasn't where it needed to be and it's the reason why we didn't have the result that we wanted. We shore that up and I think we have a better result."" Foligno wants the Jackets to play more physical in Game 3 and fire more shots toward Toronto’s net even from bad angles in an attempt to break them down. Columbus only had 12 shots on net through two periods in Game 2. ""Our forecheck needs to be better,"" the Jackets captain said. ""I mean, it’s all stuff that we know. That's why I think we're moving past it. If there's one thing about our team, we always seem to bounce back the right way and that's why I'm confident in this group and what we're going to bring tomorrow and knowing that this is a really important game for us.""   The TSN Hockey panel praises the Leafs' ""perfect response"" in their bounce back effort in Game 2, explains how Sheldon Keefe's lineup tweaks paid dividends, and credits the timeliness of some of Frederik Andersen's saves in an impressive performance.  --- In the minutes after his team's shutout loss on Tuesday night, John Tortorella was in no mood to offer reporters an autopsy. ""Toronto played a really good game,” the Jackets coach said. ""We sucked."" Tortorella repeated that comment a couple times in his Zoom session. The veteran bench boss remained tightlipped on Wednesday when asked how the Jackets can create more possession in the Leafs end. ""We're just going to play,"" he said. ""Get prepared to play the right way and go about our business."" A follow-up question led to a listing of the team itinerary. ""You guys are killing me,"" Tortorella said. ""Listen, we're going to prepare to play the game ... We had a meeting today at 11:30 a.m. with coaches. We had a 2:30 practice, we'll have an 11 o'clock meeting tomorrow and then we'll play at 8 o'clock. I'm not going to talk about what adjustments we have to make, what we have to do differently. We're going to prepare to play the right way."" The Athletic's Aaron Portzline attempted to ask about the breakdown on the second Leafs goal and, at this point, Tortorella had had enough. “What's your question, Portzy? God damn, you just keep on working me, don't you,"" Tortorella fumed. The scribe shot back, ""I keep asking you questions about playoff hockey games, yeah, sorry."" “Yeah,"" Tortorella responded, ""and I've told you I'm not interested in breaking down what's happened in the games and I've been very fair about that. All I'm telling you is I'm looking to get our team ready to play the next game and I'm sorry I don't have information for your story, but that's how we're going to go about our business.""  ”God damn, you just keep on working me...”  Tight-lipped   head coach John Tortorella maintains that he’s not interested in questions breaking down what happened in the game:    — TSN Hockey (@TSNHockey)  “It's a process,"" Tortorella said. ""He's a young player still learning to understand momentum swings in games, what is needed in certain situations when things aren't going right for him or the team. It doesn't surprise me. It happens with all young players. We've gone through quite a bit of adversity as we've played the past couple of years and I think it's good training ground for some of our young guys."" Dubois, who led the Jackets in scoring in the regular season, has failed to hit the scoresheet through two games. He was on the ice for two goals against on Tuesday night.    — Alison (@AlisonL)  ---  , who played seven seasons with Muzzin in Los Angeles, had never seen his friend stay down like he did on Tuesday night. ""That was the first time I've ever seen him need medical attention on the ice,"" Clifford said. ""Bit of a scary moment, but he's a mentally strong guy. He's a big, tough kid so we're just hoping for a speedy recovery and just go one day at a time."" Clifford appreciated that general manager Kyle Dubas kept the team apprised of Muzzin's status throughout the night. ""I know [Muzzin's wife] Courtney's obviously thinking about it and his mom and dad and everyone wants to be there by his side and we're in a different situation now with COVID,"" Clifford said. ""What I liked is we had a lot of communication. Kyle was with him and he relayed what was going on and kept us all up to date basically on an hourly schedule.""  Muzzin lost feeling in his extremities as a result of the collision, which is why he was taken to hospital. He regained feeling shortly after, however, as the Maple Leafs have acknowledged, he won’t be available for the remainder of the series.  — Darren Dreger (@DarrenDreger)    Leafs forward Kyle Clifford, who was also a teammate of Jake Muzzin's in Los Angeles, discusses the scary injury Muzzin suffered at the end of Game 2 and credits general manager Kyle Dubas for communicating updates on his health to the team. With Muzzin out, Clifford will be the only Leaf suiting up who has won a Stanley Cup. The gritty left winger only played three minutes and 21 seconds in Game 1, but made an early impression in Game 2, levelling Jackets defenceman   with a huge hit. ""It's a short series so we're in an all-in mindset with our team and when our number's called we're just going to be ready to do what provides us with the best opportunity to win the game,"" Clifford said. ""We have enough experience with [Jason] Spezza and I and Pierre [Engvall] or Goater [ ] to be ready."" Clifford played seven minutes and 36 seconds in Game 2, finishing with one shot and two hits.

They flipped the script with goals from Nylander, Tavares and Hyman to tie, and Auston Matthews wins it.   Image description text   TORONTO – To understand what it means to the   that   picked a fight, chucked his gloves and started throwing rights at Dean Kukan’s face with the season looking lost Friday night, you should know a few things. You should know that Spezza, 37, grew up a Leafs fan in this city and that he agreed to skate minimal minutes here for the lowest amount of money the club could legally agree to pay him. You should know that already this week he’s watched some of his ring-chasing contemporaries, like Henrik Lundqvist and Patrick Marleau, get kicked out of the Eastern Conference bubble with, quite literally, no fanfare. And you should know that he has four daughters aged 10 and under: Sophia, Nicola, Anna and Julia. Sometimes he reads them children’s books authored by Zach Hyman. When Spezza kissed his girls goodbye and moved into a hotel so close yet so impenetrably far away in order to play “road” games like Game 4’s 4-3 stunner over Columbus, they understood why their father would be FaceTime-only for two months, best-case scenario. “They know Daddy’s got a dream,” Spezza said. “Trying to win a Stanley Cup as a Maple Leaf is something I dreamed of as a kid.” This isn’t sacrifice. This is choice. This is opportunity, perhaps one last. So, it wasn’t that Spezza got caught up in the emotions of Elimination Night that he fought for just the seventh time in an NHL career that spans 1,207 games. It was that — after watching the Maple Leafs give up six unanswered goals in the series — he was trying to inject some emotions. No way the young guys who affectionately nicknamed him “Vintage” and picked his brain for face-off tips could possibly feel as desperate as the old fourth-liner with no job security for 2020-21. But he could help them come close. “Just trying to spark the guys,” Spezza explained of the five-minute major, which drew a chorus of stick slaps from the bench. “Just trying to show some desperation and have some pushback. Without the crowd, you don’t have that. Just trying to create some emotion and play the role that I’m in. Trying to get everyone going.” Hey, maybe the Maple Leafs’ all-stars wouldn’t have thrown down their historic three-goal, three-minute, goalie-pulled comeback without Spezza’s calculated bit of barbarianism. We’ll never know. We do know the effort of Spezza’s fourth line — which topped all units by generating 78.57 per cent of shot attempts 5-on-5 — made a tangible impact in the most important game of the year. “Jason Spezza just did not want our season to end today. He played with that level of urgency. You see the fight. That’s playoff hockey,” said coach Sheldon Keefe, unprompted.  “That’s a guy not wanting to go down — literally — without a fight.” Hyman, who slammed the tying goal with 22 seconds left in regulation, recently revealed that he and his new bride are going to have a baby this winter. The winger said he wouldn’t hesitate to call “Spezz” in the middle of the night for parenting tips. Seeing that fight meant something to Hyman. Spezza got the boys going. Somehow, with less time on the clock, the group’s belief in a comeback was better in the second intermission than the first. “He wants it more than anybody,” Hyman said. “He was a first-line player throughout his career, an all-star, Hall of Famer — and now he’s playing on the fourth line and he’s willing to drop the gloves and give our team momentum when we’re down. “He’s a real leader on our team, and he’s a huge part of our team. We all love him.”  Spezza hugging Matthews!   — Omar (@TicTacTOmar)  Game 4 was Spezza embracing his new role — critical bit player in the Leafs’ 19-act drama — to an extent that seemed almost impossible in October. To think: Spezza was healthy-scratched on Opening Night against Ottawa because former coach Mike Babcock believed he wasn’t really interested in being a fourth-liner. As Toronto’s roller-coaster season clattered and dipped, Spezza was at risk of being waived due to a salary-cap crunch. Yet some well-spaced forward injuries kept his dream on life support, and a coaching change secured more ice time. Do you believe fate? As Keefe has tinkered with his fourth unit in this series, benching Frederik Gauthier and Pierre Engvall for games, Spezza’s presence has been steady, valued. Spezza has gone out of his way to chat with quiet 18-year-old Nick Robertson, closer to Sophia’s age than his, because he remembers what it’s like being an OHL phenom wedged into an NHL playoff roster and just yearning to belong. This week he’s ditched the game-day suit and tried to embrace the young Leafs’  . Now that he’s found a niche, he doesn’t want to crawl out.     “This is a time when experience really pays off. You can be calm in pressure-packed situations, and I’ve always had good playoff performances,” Spezza said. “This is kind of what you envision — being a piece of a good team and having to be a leader.” What you don’t envision is three straight 6-on-5 goals, an overtime win and being on the fun side of an 0-3 comeback 21 hours after being on the wrong side of one. “I’ve never been a part of anything like that,” said Spezza, 17 years deep. “With the firepower we have with these guys, the way they can put the puck in the net, we’re never out of it. There’s a great sense of belief in our group.”  sorry for the quality but i’m BEGGING you all to watch jason spezza in this clip because it’s amazing   — scrappy kappy (@marnylandersen)  Sophia, Nicola, Anna and Julia couldn’t be there Friday to press their faces to the glass and watch one of the most exhilarating moments of Dad’s career. But the good thing about the bubble? It’s see-through. “They’ll be watching the games a little more eagerly because they know what has gone into it,” Spezza said. “That’s what families are for – you lean on each other in difficult times.”  A close look at Jason Spezza this morning   — GTHL Hockey (@GTHLHockey)                                           You can change your selections at any time.

Defenceman Morgan Rielly said Wednesday that while the team supports Minnesota's Matt Dumba, it won't be joining the protest during the anthems.       (Andre Ringuette/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images) Toronto Maple Leafs alternate captain Morgan Rielly says he and his teammates are in Matt Dumba's corner as he protests against racial injustice during the NHL's return to competition. However, that doesn't mean the Maple Leaf players will be raising a fist or taking a knee during the pre-game anthems. ""We've definitely talked about it. And I think that as a group, we agree with what [Dumba] had to say in terms of taking action,"" Rielly said Wednesday. ""I think that can take different forms. ""I think that there's been players on our team that have had conversations with outside people, with each other. We've talked about what we want to do moving forward. And we've talked to players that play on other teams about taking action, about doing certain things. We've chosen to go that way."" Dumba, a defenceman for the Minnesota Wild, has been raising his fist during the Canadian and U.S. anthems before games and said he will continue to do so throughout the post-season. The Regina native, who is half-Filipino, was also the first NHL player to kneel during the restart when he took a knee for the U.S. anthem before Edmonton took on Chicago on Saturday in the first restart game at Rogers Place. He also made a speech at centre ice before the game stressing the need for social and racial justice. Athletes from several professional sports leagues have been using their platform to protest racial and social injustice since the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in May. While the protests in the NHL have not been as widespread as in the NBA or Major League Soccer, some players have demonstrated during the pre-game anthems. Vegas winger Ryan Reaves, Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner and Dallas Stars forwards Jason Dickinson and Tyler Seguin knelt for the U.S. and Canadian anthems before their seeding Monday game at Rogers Place. ""It's time to start doing something, not just let this be a news cycle and forget about it and do it all over again,"" Lehner said after the game. ""Everyone should have the same chance in society, everyone should be treated the same."" The Calgary Flames are counting on Andrew Mangiapane to be a quick study in their brief do-or-die battle with the Winnipeg Jets. The young Flames winger showed a lack of discipline in Game 2 of the best-of-five playoff qualification series when he took an ill-advised retaliation penalty late in the game, cross-checking Jets forward Cody Eakin. Calgary, which was looking for an equalizing goal, instead found itself short-handed for the fifth time in the third period, ultimately stumbling to a 3-2 loss that tied the series 1-1. ""Obviously at the time I wasn't thinking and all that, but it's a 3-2 hockey game there, and you're taking a penalty, putting us on a disadvantage,"" Mangiapane said Wednesday. ""Got to learn from it, obviously, and move on."" ""We talk about there being two pains in life, the pain of discipline and the pain of regret,"" Ward said. ""Often times the pain of regret weighs a lot heavier than the pain of discipline. ""I think for him he took the message the right way. I think he had 95 per cent of it figured out himself already."" While Loui Eriksson has seen his offence dry up since joining Vancouver for the 2016-17 season, he came into the Canucks' best-of-five series with Minnesota as one of the team's few battle-tested playoff performers. He's also been a rock for some of Vancouver's talented but inexperienced core. Canucks coach Travis Green said captain Bo Horvat benefited from having Eriksson on his line. ""I think with Loui, he brings a lot of different things to the game,"" Canucks coach Travis Green said Wednesday. ""I think Bo's line played a lot better last game, and whenever we put Loui there it seems to solidify the line. ""I know if you talk to Bo he enjoys playing with Loui. If Bo's game isn't totally sharp, whenever we put Loui there it seems to help."" Add some “good” to your morning and evening. A variety of newsletters you'll love, delivered straight to you.

Now, we are continuing that with the NHL qualifying series which began recently. We are collecting some photos with humorous captions added to entertain you during this postseason play. Today we cover the  vs the   comic captions for the 2019-20 postseason. The Columbus Blue Jackets continue to amaze followers (and non-followers) with their postseason play. After the 2018-19 season, the Jackets upset the highly favoured   by sweeping them. They continued against the , losing in six games. Now, as history repeats itself, the Blue Jackets are up against the Lightning again. Think there will be some revenge in the minds of the Tampa Bay club? You bet. In this NHL qualifying series, the Blue Jackets were led by   and  who combined for nine points and five goals. The key to winning this series has to be the outstanding goaltending and defence the Columbus club displayed.   and   pulled off some quality statistics showing their value to the team. Together they collaborated for a .952 save percentage and a 1.64 goals-against-average. Stopping a powerhouse offensive team like the Leafs is something else. In the postseason, goaltending added with defence equals success, and the Blue Jackets exemplify that. Unfortunately,   and that can factor into a tough break going into the next series against the Lightning. Can the Blue Jackets repeat their domination of the Lightning? We’ll soon find out.   Here is the Columbus Blue Jackets NHL qualifying series comic caption.

(Photo by Andre Ringuette/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images) The Toronto Maple Leafs Fall Again in NHL Qualifying Series There was no way a talented club like Toronto with all their high-priced players were going to fail again… right? WRONG! Whether it’s some curse or lack of preparedness, the Maple Leafs fell like a tree again in a clinching postseason game. And, don’t forget this wasn’t even the playoffs, but the qualifying round to get to the playoffs. While the ‘Big Three’ of  ,  , and   were thrown together on the same line, the results were once again disappointing. Even with that trio tallying 13 points between them, the Toronto team tumbled to obscurity. Will there be some changes in the offseason? Perhaps, since the media had a field day describing the woes of a club who should be much better than their postseason results. It’s very obvious that the team lacks defence. They possess an awesome offence which seems to score at will, they just can’t stop the other team.   did all he could but it seemed inevitable that things would fall apart. Andersen had a 2-2-1 record with an excellent .936 save percentage and 1.84 goals-against-average. With $33.5 million dedicated to the trio described above, it seems that it’s not enough to get them past the first round in the postseason. Very discouraging to say the least. Something’s got to give. Here is the Toronto Maple Leafs NHL qualifying series comic caption.

For one thing, Montreal was the home team - in Toronto’s building. For another, the exhibition game, a precursor to the NHL’s 24-team playoff tournament opening this weekend, was happening on a summer night in late July. Then there were the empty stands at Scotiabank Arena, completely devoid of fans and ensuing crowd noise. The Canadian anthem played into a void. What scattered media and league staff members were in attendance could hear practically every word coming from the ice, colourful language and all. What didn't change was the action between whistles, an occasionally heated battle amongst divisional foes that ended in a 4-2 Toronto victory. “During the anthem was probably the moment where for me it was the most noticeable, the fact that there was no fans and you have a little moment there,” said Toronto head coach Sheldon Keefe on a Zoom call after the win. “During the anthem is a time when you're looking at the flag and you're kind of taking in the whole environment and of course, it's much different today than what you're accustomed to. It's a time when you really feel the moment, but once the puck dropped, from my perspective, it really just felt like hockey.” Toronto was powered by a pair of goals from Alex Kerfoot and a strong penalty kill against the Canadiens, in the lone exhibition match they’ll see before a Stanley Cup qualifier series starts Sunday against Columbus. While the X’s and O’s were important to get down in Tuesday’s outing, it was also a chance for players to wrap their head around what a difference the new-look rink will make to their games. “There's a lot of stuff set up in terms of the stage and the screens and what's going on there,” said Leafs captain  . “Visually, I think getting your depth perception and all that stuff [figured out] from what you’re kind of used to.There's things you're used to hearing that you're not. But overall, I think we feel there's a lot that's been put into this. It was just a whole lot of fun; there was a lot of energy within our group all day long, and throughout the game on the bench.” To that end, the Leafs didn’t take long to get rolling. Just 33 seconds into the opening frame, a two-on-one chance for Tavares and Ilya Mikheyev produced Mikheyev’s first NHL goal since Dec. 27. That game was also the last time Mikheyev suited up for the Leafs, a span of 214 days. Toronto was visiting New Jersey that night when late in the third period, the rookie had tendons and a ligament in his wrist severed by  ’s skate blade. Following surgery and extensive rehab, Mikheyev had been primed to return to the Leafs’ lineup right when the NHL hit pause amid the global COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March. Kerfoot’s first goal of the night, a shorthanded tally set up beautifully by  , had Toronto ahead 2-0 early in the second. Keefe said that the delayed reaction by the officials to the goal would probably have been remedied by more bodies in the building, joking that ""the fans would have probably called that one for us.""  responded for Montreal shortly after to pull the home team within one, but Kerfoot came back with another goal, teed up by a terrific   pass, and the Leafs carried a 3-1 advantage into the third. Montreal would cut into that lead again though, when   scored in the final frame just as a penalty to Mikheyev was expiring. But the penalty kill redeemed itself with another shorthanded goal, this one from Rielly, to seal the victory for Toronto and help Rielly finish with a three-point night. “Today was really good [for the kill],” Keefe said. “And I thought, those two guys [Rielly and Kerfoot] carried on to [strong] five-on-five play as well. It's as good as we've seen Kerf play, and that's a really healthy sign for our team, obviously. If we can get he and Kapanen going like they were today, that makes us a tough team to handle and that's really good for us.” Other than Mikheyev, the only other first-year in Toronto’s lineup was Nick Robertson, the 18-year-old OHL phenom who put up 55 goals and 86 points with the Peterborough Petes during the 2019-20 campaign. Keefe said on Monday that Robertson was the one “they’d had their eye on” throughout Phase 3’s training camp, a wild card needing to be assessed before a final decision was made on his preparedness for a real playoff game. Robertson was given top-nine billing on the Leafs’ third line with Kerfoot and Kapanen, and Keefe slotted him onto Toronto’s second power play unit. But Robertson’s NHL exhibition experience got off to an inauspicious start, when the teen was called for holding midway through the first period. The freshman did find his way to the right side of the scoresheet eventually, earning a secondary assist on Kerfoot’s second goal. “I thought he had some great sequences,” said Keefe. “It was good to see him play with some confidence with the puck. I thought he had some shifts where he was noticeable in a positive way, and that's really good to see.” Keefe was non-committal on what exactly that means for Robertson, whether he’ll remain in the Leafs’ lineup come Sunday’s opener against Columbus or if the more experienced   might slide onto the line as he did in the third period Tuesday when Montreal pulled within one. “We're going to continue to just digest all of this here over the next few days,” Keefe said. “I wouldn't make any assumptions on Nick or some of the other positions in our lineup, because we just haven't made the decisions ourselves.” With several days remaining before their next game action, the Leafs will take what they learned about themselves - and about the new normal of the NHL - and apply it to their next great challenge: winning in a playoff series. “Overall we were happy with it [tonight],” said Rielly. “The outcome it what you want but I think anytime you play any kind of preseason game like this, there's going to be some kinks to work out. I think it's a little bit different when you prepare for a week for a playoff team in the Blue Jackets and then play a team that's not them, what you talked about in practice is hard to execute but we'll take the win.”           ",2020-07-29 00:00:00

The Florida Panthers have officially parted ways with Dale Tallon, and there are questions in Toronto about whether or not this is the right offseason to break up the fabulous four.  There were rumors last week after the Florida Panthers were eliminated from the play-ins that Dale Tallon would be parting the organization. That was made official on Monday.  MONTREAL, QC – NOVEMBER 17: Florida Panthers general manager Dale Tallon (Photo by Francois Laplante/FreestylePhoto/Getty Images) The Panthers   that a search for their next GM has begun and in a statement by owner Vinnie Viola, the team said goodbye to Tallon. He said: For the last decade, Dale raised the team’s profile, attracted key players to South Florida and brought character and class to our franchise. When we purchased the Panthers in 2013, we did so with a singular goal–to win a Stanley Cup. We have not seen our efforts come to fruition. We will now begin an organizational search for the next general manager. , Vegas Golden Knights head coach Pete DeBoer revealed that forward Max Pacioretty has arrived “in the bubble,” (out of quarantine) and is expected to be ready to play for Game 1 of their playoff series against the Chicago Blackhawks. Max Pacioretty (  / The Hockey Writers) Pacioretty missed the round-robin series due to an undisclosed injury, but has officially tested negative through four tests which will allow him to practice with the team today. It will be a key addition for the Golden Knights as he scored 32 goals and 66 points in 71 games this season.  It is presumed he will jump back up on the top line.  Minnesota Wild defenseman Ryan Suter   the extent of the injuries that kept him out of the lineup against the Vancouver Canucks. Now that the team is out of the play-ins, he could share that he injured his right foot during Game 3. Unfortunately, this is the same foot he had operated on back in 2018 when he broke his ankle. The good news is, Suter said he should be fine and is going to the doctor tomorrow to get it checked further. In other Wild news,   that Mikko Koivu is not ready to make a decision on his NHL future yet. Russo quotes Koivu who said: “I need to be real careful, especially with that game and what do I want with the future and then go from there,” said Koivu, via The Athletic’s Jessi Pierce. “It’s such a big decision, there’s no way I’m ready to do that right now.” Now that the Toronto Maple Leafs are officially out of the postseason, the questions about whether or not the team should break up the big four — John Tavares, Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander — will begin.  Toronto Maple Leafs right wing Mitchell Marner and Toronto Maple Leafs centre Auston Matthews (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette) : “I do believe in a perfect world Kyle Dubas would give his big 4 one more year…this has been a bit of a strange finish, I think that’s what he would like to do.” That said, he did add that there are major concerns that the team only score three 5v5 goals the entire series. “There’s going to have to be a long conversation whether that still is the plan,” he said.  noted that it might be a little early to make such a big decision given the playoff scenario with the pandemic, but there is also a thought within the organization that it may be riskier to do nothing. The team is already going to be making some tough choices with a tight salary cap and perhaps it’s time to make major changes.  Should the Maple Leafs win the draft lottery tonight, that will change everything in terms of the feeling inside the organization to keep their top four offensive weapons in tact.  TSN Insider Bob McKenzie posted a note on Twitter today thanking fans and saying he’ll be leaving his regular role with the network. He plans to start his semi-retirement after the draft lottery on Monday and will be limited in his role with TSN moving forward.  In part of his statement he wrote: “This isn’t goodbye as much as it is, see you later. As reported earlier, I have a new five-year contract with TSN. I’ll still be kicking around some but not nearly as much.” Thank you. 🙏  — Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie)  McKenzie was one of the best insiders in the business. A well-respected source for information, he’ll be missed. That he’ll still be offering draft rankings and doing big TSN events is a relief for many.
