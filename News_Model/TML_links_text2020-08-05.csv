(Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press) The Maple Leafs sat two minutes from a resounding, feel-good victory. Then while killing a penalty late in Tuesday's third period, defenceman Jake Muzzin took a crosscheck from Pierre-Luc Dubois before stumbling and jamming his head/neck into the leg of Blue Jackets winger Oliver Bjorkstrand. When the bruising blue-liner tried to get up, he couldn't. A stretcher was eventually wheeled onto the ice inside a fan-less, deathly quiet Scotiabank Arena as players looked on from both benches during a delay that lasted nearly 15 minutes. The team announced Wednesday that Muzzin was discharged overnight and was back at the team's hotel, but would not play for the rest of the series because of the undisclosed injury.

""What he brings to our team is immeasurable,"" Toronto captain John Tavares, who scored the game's second goal, said of Muzzin. ""Certainly tough to see, especially just how much we love that guy."" The Leafs tweeted 31-year-old was transported to hospital, adding he was alert and able to move his limbs. ""We're all praying for him,"" Toronto winger Mitch Marner said. ""There's a lot bigger things than hockey."" As for the game, Auston Matthews opened the scoring for the Leafs, finding a crack in Korpisalo on Toronto's 56th shot of the series after the 26-year-old netminder making his post-season debut recorded a 2-0 shutout in Sunday's opener. Frederik Andersen made 20 saves to record his first post-season shutout with Toronto, the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL's 24-team restart to its pandemic-delayed campaign. Morgan Rielly added an empty netter with 42.6 seconds left as the Leafs dominated from start to finish. ""We forechecked really hard,"" Toronto head coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""Our guys brought it to another level from a competitive standpoint."" Korpisalo, who made 28 saves in Game 1, stopped 36 shots for No. 9 Columbus, which will look to rebound in Thursday's Game 3. ""Toronto played a really good game,"" said always-fiery Blue Jackets head coach John Tortorella. ""We sucked."" With the Leafs coming in waves, Matthews deftly redirected a Zach Hyman pass off the rush beyond Korpisalo's blocker on Toronto's 28th shot with exactly four minutes left in the second — a goal that would have blown the roof off the building in a normal post-season encounter. Instead, the players on the ice and bench made all the noise inside their home rink, which is playing host to the East teams as part of the Toronto hub because of COVID-19. The goal sequence was one of the few where Blue Jackets defenceman Seth Jones wasn't out against Matthews, and the Leafs' star centre made them pay. Before that breakthrough, however, it looked like Toronto might never solve Korpisalo, who was lights out behind a stingy defensive structure that worked to perfection against the high-flying Leafs less than 48 hours earlier. ""Those thoughts can creep in,"" Tavares said. ""But when we're playing like that, we have so much belief in each other, and with the type of team we have, that eventually it's going to pay off."" After outshooting the Blue Jackets 15-6 in the first Tuesday, Toronto continued to press in the second. William Nylander couldn't tuck his effort home at the side of the net on a power play with Korpisalo down-and-out before Tavares had two chances right in front, and another from the slot. Leafs defenceman Justin Holl had golden opportunity pinching down, but Korpisalo was there again as Columbus barely touched the puck in the middle period. Andersen was solid in making 33 saves in Game 1, but disappointed by the one he missed — an innocent shot off the rush from Cam Atkinson that proved to be the difference before a late empty-netter. Toronto's Kyle Clifford knocks over Columbus' Dean Kukan with a hit in the first period.       (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press) The Toronto netminder didn't have much to do Tuesday, but had to be sharp with the teams playing 4-on-4 after Matthews finally solved Korpisalo. Blue Jackets defenceman Zach Werenski had a chance off the rush and Atkinson was there on the follow. ""What happens in their end is useless to think about,"" said Andersen, who had two post-season shutouts when he was a member of the Anaheim Ducks. ""I just focus on what I can do."" Columbus, which stunned the Presidents' Trophy-winning Tampa Bay Lightning in a first-round sweep last spring before losing stars Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Sergei Bobrovsky in free agency, tried to get going early in the third. But with Werenski caught down low in the offensive zone, Tavares, who had a rough Game 1, was sprung free on a break and beat Korpisalo under the blocker at 4:56. Korpisalo kept his team within striking distance by stopping Matthews on a 2-on-1 break midway through the period, but Toronto coasted from there, save for Muzzin's scary injury, to even the series 1-1. The Leafs were once again the ""home"" team inside a frigid Scotiabank Arena on a muggy August afternoon, but with a 4 p.m. ET start — the second of three games at the venue Tuesday — they set up shop in the reconfigured media centre and not their usual locker room. The Blue Jackets, meanwhile, were in the Toronto Raptors' digs down the hall. Keefe tweaked his top-6 forward group, with Marner joining Matthews and Hyman, while Nylander moved to the wing on the second line with Tavares and Ilya Mikheyev. Toronto started on its toes, with bruising winger Kyle Clifford steamrolling Dean Kukan early in the first — a hit that would have had the home crowd frothing at the mouth in normal times. ""We came out with a strong push,"" Matthew said. ""Just a full effort throughout the lineup."" The Leafs will be looking for more of the same — likely without Muzzin — on Thursday night.

Image description text   TORONTO – “Toronto was really good. We sucked.” If our column’s word count for Game 2 of the  –  series could total six, John Tortorella’s post-game assessment would do the trick. Send file. Lift feet. Crack beer.  The Blue Jackets head coach had zero interest in breaking down a lacklustre showing that suddenly has his bunch all knotted up at one game apiece with the Maple Leafs, convincing 3-0 winners Tuesday evening. In a press conference that didn’t last much longer than his mid-game chew-out of top centre Pierre-Luc Dubois, Tortorella thrice said that his team “sucked” and that Toronto was “really good.” Then he walked away in his tracksuit and began plotting for some Game 3 revenge. One man’s burn-the-tape performance is another’s play-it-on-repeat masterpiece. Sheldon Keefe’s first postseason victory as an NHL head coach was about as convincing as it gets. A little right-wing flip in the top six and a little pressure to crack the fortress resulted in a flood of momentum. “We were just focused,” Keefe said. The big guns came to play and stayed patient through what could’ve been a frustrating goaltending performance by Joonas Korpisalo, reminding Leafs Nation that the twin engines of great teams run up the middle. Does doubt crawl into a star player’s mind when everything they’ve thrown at the opponent’s net for nearly five periods gets kicked away, gloved down or ends in a  ping ? “Certainly, those thoughts can creep in, but I think as a team when we’re playing like that, we have so much belief in each other that eventually it’s going to pay off. We’re gonna break through,” captain John Tavares said. “You’re just kinda staying in the moment, waiting for the next opportunity.” Auston Matthews, centring a new-look top line with Mitch Marner to his right, finally busted headstand artist Korpisalo’s shutout streak 56 saves and 96 minutes deep into the series by deftly tipping a Zach Hyman feed off the rush. “Everything is tight out there, and goals are hard to come by,” said Matthews, who also threw a couple hits. “It was nice to get that one and kind of jump-start a nice push.” Then Tavares capped off a stellar eight-shot effort by foiling Korpisalo on a breakaway. In both instances, Columbus’s top defensive pairing took a minus and Zach Werenski got caught deep on a rush of his own, retreating behind the play with his face pointed at his own net, the red lamp alight by the time he got there. This is Maple Leafs hockey at its best — speedy, space-creating, and executing on great looks. Toronto dominated play 5-on-5, outshooting the Jackets 27-10, doubling up their foes in scoring chances 26-13, and tripling them up in high-danger opportunities 9-3 (per naturalstattrick.com). The more wide open, the better for the boys in blue and white.  Torts and Dubois with a heated exchange on the bench.     — NHL Watcher (@NHL_Watcher)  By storming in Matthews- and Tavares-led waves, the Leafs were able to gloss over a concerning 0-for-6 performance on the power-play in this series. And a lead gave Keefe the luxury of throwing out Kyle Clifford’s energy line more often than when he was chasing Game 1. The vaunted Columbus forecheck never posed a threat because by the time the Jackets dumped the puck in, they were so tired, they needed to change. “I just think we didn’t have it tonight. That’s really the difference,” Columbus captain Nick Foligno said. “You can dissect it any way you want, but it ultimately came down to we didn’t play a very good game. It’s unacceptable.” Toronto, meanwhile, enjoyed a string of positive developments. Rookie Nick Robertson drew a penalty and didn’t hesitate to let a few pucks rip on the second power-play unit. Frederik Andersen stopped all 21 shots he faced for a third career postseason shutout and improved his series save percentage to an NHL-best .982. Morgan Rielly, William Nylander, and Alexander Kerfoot all got their names into the boxscore. Most important: Toronto’s will matched its skill, and thus hinted at what’s possible when there is an urgency to churn legs, draw penalties and battle for second chances. “Our guys brought it to another level tonight from a competitive standpoint,” said Keefe, who was closely monitoring the mood on the bench during the drought.  “The goalie was a big difference for them, but I really liked how our guys just took a drink of water and got ready for the next shift and stayed with it.” Apply enough pressure, and the dam will break. “There were certainly more people in front than the first game,” said Korpisalo, the best Blue Jacket on the ice. The heart-in-your-throat scene of seeing Jake Muzzin being stretchered off and driven to a hospital after a frightening Dubois cross-check — and the status of the top shutdown defenceman’s health — will no doubt be the topic of greatest concern for this city’s hockey team as action rolls on.  Blue Jackets' Zach Werenski: ""First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with Jake Muzzin. … No hockey game is as important as someone's health so we're thinking of him right now.""  — Dave Stubbs (@Dave_Stubbs)  When these sides do meet again, for a third installment of run-and-gun and ground-and-pound, Toronto will try to replicate Game 2 and Columbus will attempt to throw it back to Game 1. As Keefe notes, each game takes on a personality of its own. This one was all Leafs — flash, dash and keep the puck in the fun zone. “We expect them to make some adjustments,” Tavares said, “but I liked the way we were in sync and connected.” A best-of-three starts Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. Not sucking will be of utmost importance.                                     You can change your selections at any time. Select as many teams as you like from the leagues below.

Please read our   first.       					THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette				   I have a simple message for   fans — take a deep breath. After losing Game 1 of their best-of-five   playoff qualifier 2-0 against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday night, many of Toronto’s fans are already getting themselves in position to abandon ship and call it a series.   Now, on one hand, I can’t blame those fans for thinking that way given this team’s playoff stumbles over the last handful of years. But Game 1 at Scotiabank Arena was a virtual toss-up. Scoreless through two periods, both teams had their opportunities to put the puck in the net, but Toronto’s   and Columbus’ Joonas Korpisalo were very good between the pipes, making 33 and 28 saves, respectively.     🗨️ We have to find a way to break them down, get quality looks, second and third opportunities and finish on some of our chances. 🎥 Today's media mashup |    — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Game 2 will be waged on Tuesday night, and the Maple Leafs are expected to show a little bit more determination and come flying out of the gate, so the first 10 minutes of the hockey game will be vitally important for both teams.    That brings me to the key to this series — the first goal of the game. Scoring the first goal is massive for each team because it plays to their strengths and dictates how the rest of the game will flow.   The Leafs and Jackets each won 24 games when scoring first during the 2019-20 regular season, and wouldn’t you know it, each team lost only five times when they opened the scoring in a game.     If Columbus scores first, they can do what they do best, focus on their defence-first mindset and concentrate on shutting down Toronto’s highly skilled top six forwards.   But a first tally for Toronto would force the Blue Jackets to open up their style and potentially expose themselves defensively to a Maple Leafs’ counter-attack. Game 1 offered up a great chess match over the first two periods and the team that scores first Tuesday night may again end up winning.  is the assistant program, news and senior sports director at Global News Radio 900 CHML.

But when Toronto aims to even the best-of-five in Tuesday’s Game 2, Marner has a plan in place to earn a little redemption. “Definitely [didn’t have] enough shots on net, didn't produce enough offensively,” Marner assessed of his performance to reporters on a Zoom call from the NHL’s Eastern Conference hub at the Royal York Hotel on Monday. “The goal tomorrow night is just to have more confidence with the puck, not to try to throw stuff away, skate more with it in my hands and try to make more plays with the puck, and just have confidence with it. But at the same time, be responsible and smart with it.” Marner was the only top-nine forward for Toronto that didn’t put a puck on Blue Jackets goaltender   in the Leafs’ 2-0 loss, and that was while his line with   and Ilya Mikheyev produced Toronto’s highest possession numbers of the game at 62 per cent. The problem was Columbus’ stifling defence, and the work of   and  . The Blue Jackets were the third-best defence in the NHL this season, going up against the league’s third-best offence in the Leafs. But that defence tandem did solid work taking away areas of the ice that Marner and Tavares can usually capitalize on, and robbed them repeatedly of gaining momentum in the offensive end.  “I think they did a good job inside their zone, keeping five tight,” Marner said. “Not a lot of shots got through and when they did, opportunities for a second [chance] weren't really there. We're trying to figure out ways to get by that. We've talked about those second opportunities today, and it's something that we’ve got to get better at and something we need to get better at in this series if we want to keep going.” Tavares also struggled to find his footing on Sunday, finishing with three shots on goal and mirroring Marner’s minus-two rating. While  ’ unit with   and   saw more of Columbus’ top defence pairing in   and  , Savard and Gavrikov handled Tavares’ group just as well. “They commit themselves, and block a lot of shots,” Tavares said. “They do a really good job of protecting the front of the net and the middle of the ice and the high-danger scoring areas. Now it’s about doing the best we can breaking them down, drawing them out away from the net, make them have to defend and play in their own end consistently. I'd like to think over 60 minutes you can wear them down.” It was the Leafs who had the wind taken out of their sails in Sunday’s third period, when a 0-0 stalemate was broken early in the third period by  ’s wrister beating  ’s blocker. Reproducing a similar play off the rush that would fool Korpisalo is something Marner and Tavares have done numerous times before, but Columbus’ reputation as defensive stalwarts proved to be only too true in Game 1. The Blue Jackets were the NHL’s best team in the regular season at defending against the rush, something Tavares’ group especially will need to find their way around. “This team is going to make it really hard for us offensively, in particular on the rush, a spot where Mitch and John have a lot of success,” said head coach Sheldon Keefe. “Because of that, we have to find different ways to score and that's an adjustment. Scoring is what we really need. We just need those guys to be playing at their best, especially now coming off of a loss. We think everybody on our team has got another level to get to and we're going to need it tomorrow.” While Tavares has talked frequently since entering the NHL’s “bubble” about the importance of Toronto being comfortable in these unprecedented conditions, it was the Blue Jackets who were feeling a little too cushy on the ice Sunday. And that’s something the Leafs can try to counteract. “They play their team identity, their structure very well. They're very comfortable in those types of [one-goal] games,” Tavares said. “They play really well as a five man unit and playing five on the inside, they have a comfort level there. I think we have to adjust and adapt with the way we want to play and the skill sets that we have and starting with myself, I have to do a better job of finding ways to break them down and create the opportunities that we need.” It’s all easier said than done, of course. The reality for Toronto now is it has to win three of these next four games to advance into the NHL’s round of 16. But if Monday’s practice was any indication to Keefe, his team is up for the challenge ahead.  “That's what their system is designed to do, is to frustrate you,” he said of Columbus. “We’ve talked a lot about that. But the good news is in just talking to our guys and the type of practice that we had, our guys are not frustrated. Our guys are hungry to get back at it and recognize where we can get better and know that we have more to give so we'll be ready to play tomorrow.”           "

The Maple Leafs were third in the NHL in goals per game in the regular season (3.39). Teams with a 2-0 lead are 55-1 (98.2 percent) winning a best-of-5 NHL series (39-1 when used from 1980-86). The New York Islanders defeated the Washington Capitals in a 1985 series.  Here are 3 keys to Game 2:   1. Will Maple Leafs reunite top players?

""It's something that I've looked at at different times throughout the game, and obviously anytime you do something like that, it has an impact on the rest of your lineup all the way through, and depth is important to us,"" Keefe said after practice Monday. ""So considering all things, I haven't decided on anything firmly, but we'll see how the game goes and make some decisions as we get moving.""   2.

When the NHL was considering hub cities in order for hockey to return, the preference was to have one on the east side and the other on the west. They were able to accomplish that as the hub cities ended up being the beautiful city of Toronto and Edmonton. When the league was selecting hub cities, many things were taken into consideration. One of the biggest things the league was trying to avoid was  . This meant having the Eastern Conference on the west coast and the Western Conference on the east coast. That wasn’t the case though as the   will be playing their games at Scotiabank Arena. Even with the Leafs playing all their games in their home city, there’s no real advantage for the team. Usually when talking about home ice advantage, the biggest thing that factors into that is the fans. When playing at home, you have more fans cheering you on which energizes and motivates the players. When the Leafs play at home, the seats are filled with a sea of blue but there are no fans at the games. Another thing about playing at home is the players get to sleep in their own beds. While this doesn’t go to all players, some like their own bed a lot more than a hotel bed due to comfort, being able to be surrounded by family, familiarity of the city and its surrounding as well as other factors. Toronto Maple Leafs Floral Swimming Trunks - 2XL Even though they’re in Toronto, the Leafs “travelling party” can’t stay at their houses in which they are staying at the Royal York hotel. Also for home games, the home team usually has access to more amenities like a nicer locker room for example. The Toronto Maple Leafs will still have access to their locker room but in games three and four (if necessary), they will have to use the visitor locker room as they are the away team. As expected, the Leafs locker room is a lot nicer than the visitor’s locker room at Scotiabank Arena and a weird feeling may kick in for the players when not being able to use their normal space their accustomed to. Let’s just say fans were allowed to go to games. The arena would be packed, especially when the Leafs play. Fans or no fans though, at the end of the day, it’s just hockey being played on ice that’s no different from the ice in say Philadelphia or Boston. It’s not like baseball where the home team gets to bat last and have the advantage of the bottom of the 9th if they trail at that point and know the surroundings of their home field. In baseball, each major league diamond is different than one another but in hockey, all the ices in the different arenas are the same. Also, it could be weird for the players to play in a relatively quiet environment and seeing nothing in the crowd when they look up. While it will be different, all these players were used to playing with very few people in the seats when they were kids which goes to members of both teams. Despite playing in their home city, they have no home ice advantage and they just showed that with a game one loss.        Newsletter   Your Toronto Maple Leafs.  Your Inbox. Every Day.

2020-08-02 14:38:40.364826,https://thehockeywriters.com/maple-leafs-mikheyev-kerfoot-spezza-2020-playoffs/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjSna3x2oTrAhXHE4gKHXfABoIQ0Y8FMAh6BAgBEAI&usg=AOvVaw2KWUO6Fa7nyIjhmQd9b736,"             It’s a well-known fact that the Toronto Maple Leafs boast one of the best offensive units in the NHL. All the focus seems to be on the team’s top offensive threats heading into the postseason, and rightfully so. Of the six players to score double-digit goals, five scored 15 or more during the regular season, all of whom are in their top-six forward group. The Maple Leafs’ secondary scoring and contributions from the bottom-six forwards proved that they can be key factors during the regular season. The Leafs could’ve had more goal scorers with double-digits, if weren’t for players missing time with injuries as well as late-season call-ups. Alexander Kerfoot and Jason Spezza had nine and Ilya Mikheyev, Andreas Johnsson (both missed significant time with injuries) and Pierre Engvall had eight. They could’ve had an additional five goal scorers in that category. Toronto Maple Leafs right wing Ilya Mikheyev, centre Alexander Kerfoot, defenceman Morgan Rielly and defenceman Rasmus Sandin celebrate a goal. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov) The Maple Leafs have the scoring depth, and many players that have been underrated all season could prove to be key factors that can attribute to the team’s success. During the training camp and exhibition game against the Montreal Canadiens, multiple players have elevated their play and caught the eye of many, especially the coaching staff. Here are three Maple Leaf players that could fly under the radar during the postseason. It didn’t take long for Mikheyev to get comfortable in North America. He recorded six points in eight games and only got better as the season progressed. During what seemed like an impressive rookie season, he eventually hit a bump in the road after   that kept him out of the lineup for three months. When the season was paused, many players needed the added time to heal up, and Mikheyev was one of those that benefited. It seemed to have worked. He came to camp   than ever. He seems to be on another level than he was before he sustained his injury. Ilya Mikheyev, Toronto Maple Leafs (  / The Hockey Writers) It’s a small sample, but Mikheyev was one of the major standouts during the Maple Leafs training camp. Being placed on a line with John Tavares and Mitch Marner, there seemed to be another gear in his game that was untapped before. He’s putting forth the effort and keeping up with the two as the line had immediate chemistry. While he performed well starting off in a third-line role, Mikheyev exceeded those expectations. He was given the opportunity to be an essential factor in a more prominent role for the Maple Leafs and he hasn’t taken it for granted. He   during one of the team’s scrimmages and went further scoring the first goal of their game against the Canadiens in only 33 seconds. Mikheyev has flown under the radar all season considering his contributions. His 23 points had him ranked 13 th  among rookie skaters and was averaging 0.59 points per game. He also had a strong Corsi-for percentage when he was on the ice, at 53.48. He even found time on the penalty kill, averaging 1:55 of ice time per game. Already with great numbers, they could’ve been higher if he didn’t suffer a serious injury. The fact that he’s moved higher in the lineup shows that head coach Sheldon Keefe has faith in Mikheyev’s ability to be an impactful player in a more prominent role. If he can continue to produce and be effective in a top-six role like we’ve seen so far, then Mikheyev’s contributions will help the Maple Leafs in the postseason. When the Maple Leafs acquired Kerfoot in the blockbuster deal that also saw Tyson Barrie come over in the Nazem Kadri deal, Kerfoot was going to be a different player than Kadri.  Fans weren’t going to see the same tenacious, in-your-face style that Kadri played. They were getting a more refined, defensive style that would benefit the team. After recording back-to-back 40-point seasons with the Colorado Avalanche, Kerfoot seemed to have taken a step back and  . A rough season is an understatement – a new system, new coach, new environment, a coaching change, switching from centre to wing, and facial surgery. That’s a lot to go through in your first season with a new team. From what we saw when the Maple Leafs returned, Kerfoot was one of those players that seemed to have regained his confidence and was more comfortable with his play. This couldn’t have come a better time for the third line centre.  Alexander Kerfoot, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) THW’s own Adam Reid came out with a great article on the Maple Leafs  . Reid talks about how more engaged Kerfoot was in all three zones and how a player like him could make a big impact during the postseason. Kerfoot was by far the best the forward on the ice for the Maple Leafs against the Canadiens and his line with Nick Robertson and Kasperi Kapanen was absolutely dominant throughout the game. Kerfoot recorded two goals, one being short-handed and the other tipping in Morgan Rielly’s point shot. He was a workhorse all over the ice, going into the corners and battling in front of the net, while showing his defensive capabilities in his own end and on the penalty kill. This is the type of play that Kerfoot wanted to have on a consistent basis all season. He has the ability to do the little things on the ice right. Plays like that are underappreciated, but they become extremely important in the playoffs. That is where Kerfoot can be even more valuable to his team’s success. I was originally going to pick Nick Robertson in this space. He quickly   during camp and didn’t look out of place at all in his first pro game. But, in this case, the veteran who has had a successful career is too important to not mention. Spezza, the oldest member of the team, doesn’t get as much credit as he deserves. While his days as a top offensive producer are behind him, he’s still capable of playing really well and being a complementary piece in a depth role. Being on a team as young as the Maple Leafs, Spezza is still relied on to be a voice in the dressing room.  At 37 years old, time isn’t on Spezza’s side in hopes of winning a Stanley Cup. A deep run with the Maple Leafs   to the veteran of 17 seasons. The closest he came was back in 2006-07 when his Ottawa Senators fell short to the Anaheim Ducks in the Cup Final. During that run, Spezza posted 7 goals and 15 assists. Throughout his career, he’s recorded 70 points in 80 playoff games. That experience and production speak volumes to Spezza’s attitude, determination, and the impact he can have with the Maple Leafs during this run. Toronto Maple Leafs forward Jason Spezza (THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Jeffrey T. Barnes) From everything that he’s endured this season, including a possible  , you can bet that Spezza is going to be hungry and motivated this time around. He still has a great shot, recording nine goals this season. His 56.52 high-danger goals-for percentage ranks second on the team to Auston Matthews with a minimum of 500 minutes played. Even though he’s in a depth role, Spezza can still be an important factor for the Maple Leafs offense by jumping into the play every now and then. Depth players always seem to step up during the playoffs. Spezza can be that player who can rise to the occasion and be an important piece to the Maple Leafs’ success. Aside from their “go-to” players, the Maple Leafs have many others that can make significant contributions during the postseason. A team with depth always finds success in the playoffs, and Toronto has an abundance of it where they can go above and beyond.   start:tags     end:tags    start:article footer     end:article footer         Ezoic - BottomNative - native_bottom    placeholder 111 blocked.

But they’ll  really  be back on Sunday night, when their best-of-five qualifying round series kicks off against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Entering that series, here are four questions the Maple Leafs are facing. The 2019-20 season has been a tumultuous one for Maple Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen from a performance perspective (career-low .909 save percentage and 2.85 goals against average). Still, the workload hasn’t wavered. Sportsnet’s Luke Fox   that since 2016, when Toronto acquired Andersen, the goalie has faced 7,748 shots and stopped 7,142 of them — both NHL highs by roughly 300. Andersen has made the most starts (244) in that span as well. Patience doesn’t last forever, but Andersen has built enough trust with Toronto to retain his spot entering the playoffs. Keep in mind that he has been the only Maple Leaf in the crease during their past three playoff runs. His backup, Jack Campbell, has zero NHL playoff experience. In the best-of-five series at least, it’ll likely stay that way. NHL Playoff Bracket 2020: Times, TV Schedule, Streams, Odds, Picks For Tuesday’s Hockey Games Lakers’ Title Hopes Hinge On Anthony Davis — Not LeBron James Cash-Strapped FC Barcelona Will Try To Sell Six Players Before Signing New Ones Mikheyev needed all of 33 seconds on Tuesday to respond to that question. Can you believe this was Mikheyev’s first competitive shift since December? Not too shabby. During Toronto’s recent training camp, coach Sheldon Keefe   the 25-year-old rookie had “a little extra jump,” which is impressive given that he was already among the fastest skaters on the team. Mikheyev was also named the MVP of the Maple Leafs’ camp and looks primed to skate on a line with John Tavares. For a guy who skated almost entirely with the team’s bottom-six in the winter, that’s huge. Now we’ll get to see how real Mikheyev’s per 60 stats are, which rank among the best on the team (at 5-on-5): Seriously, quiz your friend on who leads the Maple Leafs in even-strength points per 60. I’m certain they won’t pick Mikheyev.  If he can drive offense like this, Toronto will somehow be an even scarier scoring machine. Aside from not having to travel to the hub city ... pretty much nothing! We know there won’t be fans, but the league’s efforts to level the playing field goes further than that. Toronto will serve as the home team for some games at Scotiabank Arena (the first two, and the fifth if necessary against Columbus), but they’ll have to be the road team as well. That means relinquishing their own dressing room, as they did Tuesday for the Canadiens. The NHL has put up generic signage in the rink, too, and home teams will get some creature comforts like goal songs, win songs, hype videos, etc. Off the ice, the Maple Leafs are still required to quarantine in a hotel just like everybody else. They are one of seven Eastern Conference teams staying at the Fairmont Royal York in downtown Toronto, while five teams are at Hotel X just west of downtown. Royal York is closer to the rink, but Hotel X is actually the more modern facility, with a rooftop pool, tennis courts and immediate access to BMO Field (which Sportsnet’s Chris Johnston   will be accessible to players who want to grill, work out or just relax).  So even in their own city, the Maple Leafs don’t have the optimal place to stay. OK, we don’t really have the answer for this one. They certainly  can  beat Columbus, but the results will have to play themselves out in the next week or two. For what it’s worth, Toronto is 3-1-1 against Columbus in the past two years, including 1-0-1 this year. By  As I examined two months ago, this matchup can be simplified as offense (Toronto) vs. defense (Columbus). There are always more layers than that, but you get the basic picture. And hey, it might even be fun! The most pressing question to ask is probably whether or not the NHL can survive through to the end of this season. We certainly hope the answer is a resounding yes.

SPORTSCENTRE Reporter   In Toronto's 4-2 exhibition win on Tuesday, William Nylander had a quiet night with no shots on net, one giveaway and a minus-one rating against the Canadiens.  ""I'm pushing him, because I think he's capable of more in our practices and our scrimmages and in our game the other day,"" said head coach Sheldon Keefe. ""I'm expecting him to raise it to another level like he's shown he's capable of doing. Obviously, he's an important piece for us."" Nylander doesn't mind some tough love. He produced 31 goals in 68 games in the regular season and has high expectations for himself.  ""I want to be a dominant player out there,"" the 24-year-old said. ""That's my goal every day to go out there and bring it. Sometimes Sheldon has to kick me in the butt, but that's good."" Keefe also coached Nylander in the American Hockey League and while the Swede sometimes needs that extra push to get up to top speed, the work ethic and desire is not in question.  ""He always wants to be the first guy on the ice and he's putting in his extra work,"" Keefe noted. ""In the regular season, we'd schedule off days and he would find his way to the facility to get on the ice and work on different things so he's a very committed guy."" Nylander's doggedness was on display in the regular season as he was among the league leaders in takeaways in the offensive zone. If the Leafs lost possession, Nylander worked immediately to get it back.  ""Willie's nasty,"" said defenceman   who shared the podium with Nylander during Thursday's Zoom session. “He's got world-class hands and vision and he's so crafty and he moves well out there and he'll sneak up on ya and grab it and find a guy backdoor. Willie's a world-class playmaker so I love getting on the ice with him and he's always looking for me."" Nylander smiled throughout Barrie's answer.  ""That’s very nice of you Tys,"" he said. ""No problem,"" Barrie responded.  William Nylander put together a solid regular season statistically before the NHL was forced to pause operations, racking up 31 goals and 28 assists in 68 games. Head coach Sheldon Keefe and several of Willy's teammates described his 'world class' playmaking ability and why they think he's capable of more production in the playoffs. Mark Masters has more. ---  landed the biggest hit of Tuesday's exhibition game levelling Montreal’s Alex Belzile in the second period. The 31-year-old defenceman, who helped Toronto kill off six Habs power plays, appears to be among the players most ready for puck drop in the qualifying round.  ""Jake's camp has been really good, but I thought in the exhibition game in particular he really looked like he was making a statement in terms of how prepared he was and how committed he is to being a difference maker for us,"" Keefe gushed. ""He was involved in all areas of the game. He was our most physical player as we expect him to be [but] to do it at the level that he did in the first exhibition game for a veteran player like himself, you know, he just wants to be as prepared as possible for the games that really count here starting on Sunday. He was involved physically, he was involved in the rush offensively, he was great on the penalty kill, defensively, all those things. He very much looks like he's ready to go."" Muzzin, one of two players on the Leafs roster with a Stanley Cup ring, likes the feeling he's getting from the team.  ""We're a hungry group,"" Muzzin said. ""There's obviously been a lot of talk of taking the next step and we're committed to doing that. We have a lot of guys in here who are hungry to win. We have some youth, we have some experience and we have an excited group. Lots to prove going into the playoffs and our team is ready.""  After breaking his hand just weeks before the NHL pushed pause on the regular season, Jake Muzzin has made an immediate impact throughout his return. From his presence at practices to a massive hit in the Maple Leafs' lone exhibition game, Muzzin is ready to lead Toronto's playoff run. --- The players are still getting used to life inside the National Hockey League bubble.  ""Probably the toughest thing is not a lot of outdoor time,"" said Barrie, a Victoria native. ""It's beautiful in Toronto right now. We were just driving by Lakeshore and everyone's out riding bikes and cruising down by the water so being in the hotel you feel a bit cooped up sometimes."" “It's a pretty good set-up for us,"" said Nylander. ""We have restaurants to go to and we've been playing a lot of video games so I guess that's positive."" It seems to be a bigger adjustment for the older guys like  , a father of four, who isn't used to the sound of silence.  ""My room is a lot quieter than my house is so that's a little bit of a change, but you just adapt,"" the 37-year-old said. ""Lots of naps and sleeping in when you normally wouldn't.""  The competitiveness doesn’t stop off the ice 🤣   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  John Tortorella is already in playoff mode with the media. Asked what his message will be to players about the difference between a best-of-seven and best-of-five series, the Blue Jackets bench boss wouldn't bite. “It's none of your business what I'm saying to the players."" What does   have to do better to hold his own against Toronto's top centres?  ""How do you know where he's going to play and who he's going to play against? That's beyond me,"" Tortorella shot back. ""All our guys need to continue to improve in all facets of their game. I'm not going to single out one guy and tell him what he needs to improve. We need to be the best we can be."" Earlier this week, Tortorella begrudgingly agreed to answer one question about Keefe, whom he coached in Tampa for parts of three seasons from 2000 to 2003.  ""I'm not going to talk about this a long time,"" Tortorella warned. ""I'm sure Keefer doesn't want to talk about me a long time. I'm talking about it one time. I have a tremendous amount of respect for that guy. As far as how he played, he was one of the most competitive players I coached. I didn't coach him a lot of games, but when he played he knew one way and that was to play hard. Did I think he was going to become a coach? I don't know. That's years ago. I know you want this sexy story, but there's nothing there. The only reason I'm talking about him now, talking about the other coach, who we'll be playing in a few days, is because he's an ex-player of mine and I will not disrespect him by not saying a couple of words about him. But, I'm done with it now. I wish nothing but the best for that guy other than this series here.

But rather than rely solely on Thursday night’s Blue Jackets-Bruins’ exhibition intel, Keefe saw much of what he needed to know in a jolting TV mini-series from last year we’d call Terror in Tampa Bay. The shocking plot twist saw the Jackets knock out the top seeded Lightning in four straight, blunting the offensive threats of Nikita Kucherov, Steven Stamkos and others. Keefe is trying to avoid the same fate befalling Auston Matthews and whippets Mitch Marner and William Nylander.   “I watched more than enough video, looking at the job they did last year,” Keefe said Thursday after morning practice. “Out of curiosity, this time last year, I was watching all their games against Tampa Bay and Boston (in the second round). That’s fresh in my mind. They had players no longer there (Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Sergei Bobrovsky), but the core of their team, the players who make up who they are and how they want to play, remain and their leadership is clearly there.” Not that Keefe, general manager Kyle Dubas and others weren’t going to Scotiabank Arena on Thursday to grade the Jackets’ forward lines in their exhibition against Boston, to look for holes to exploit against their stingy defence and see of Joonas Korpisalo or Elvis Merzlikins shapes up as Sunday’s starter in Game 1 of the best-of-five qualifier. “The bulk of our work is done,” Keefe said. “We’ll be prepared on Sunday.” The teams have not seen each other since the second of two early season games in October, the third meeting cancelled by COVID-19 a week before the schedule was halted. If they were real keeners, Keefe and the Leafs could’ve also watched the Jackets inter-squad game the team put on YouTube last week. “It’s a lot about worrying about ourselves,” said veteran Toronto forward Jason Spezza. “We’ve tweaked a lot of our details and Sheldon’s done a good job kind of having themes throughout camp. Like any playoff series, as it goes on, you’re going to adjust to what the other team is doing. I’m sure they’ll have good video for us (Friday), but more so you have to get yourself up and running.”  Hardly a day goes by in this long prelude to the playoffs that the high scoring Leafs haven’t harped on proving themselves at the playoff level. William Nylander is certainly under that microscope, 20-plus goal campaigns in three of the last four seasons, but only one goal in each of the past three series, all first-round losses. He welcomes some tough love from the coach. “I want to be a dominant player, that’s my goal every day,” Nylander insisted Thursday. “Sometimes Sheldon is there to kick me in the butt. That’s good.” Keefe says he’s encouraged that Nylander has already made strides in his off-ice approach to the game this season, slipping into the rink on scheduled off days for the club and one of the first on the ice at practice. “We’ve seen great growth in him,” Keefe said. “I’m pushing him more because I think he’s capable of more.”  As much as he scrutinized 18-year-old winger Nick Robertson in his first NHL exhibition game on Tuesday, Keefe was impressed at what 31-year-old defenceman and Cup winner Jake Muzzin brought to an essentially meaningless scrimmage. Muzzin delivered a couple of big hits and paced himself all evening. “Jake’s camp has been great and in the game, he looked like he was making a statement in terms of how prepared he was and how committed he is to being a difference maker for us,” Keefe said. “In all areas of the game he was our most physical player as we expect him to be. But to do that in the first exhibition game, he was involved in the rush, he was great on the penalty kill and defensively, all those things. He very much looks like he’s ready to go.” With more time to acclimatize to life in Toronto after nearly a decade with the Kings, Muzzin also wants to see his new team assert itself in coming weeks. “We’re a hungry group and there’s obviously a lot of talk about taking the next step,” Muzzin said. “We have some youth, some experience and we have an excited group in there.”  A few days in the Royal York hotel bubble, with their lone off-site outing the bus ride to the practice rink, finds the Leafs coping well, enjoying the food and camaraderie, though missing some personal freedoms.  “Not a ton of outdoor time,” said Barrie.  “And it’s beautiful in Toronto right now. We were just driving by the lakeshore and everyone’s out riding bikes and kind of cruising by the water. Being in the hotel, you kind of feel cooped up sometimes, but it’s all good.”  Spezza, the father of four young girls, said he’s enjoying a couple of sleep-ins.  “We’re on hockey players’ schedules now, a couple of naps when normally you wouldn’t do it. My room (players have their own quarters) is a lot quieter than my house is.”  Thursday’s workout had a welcome guest. Winger Andreas Johnsson, coming back from major late winter knee surgery, but included on the playoff roster, appeared for the special teams’ drills. He’s not been ruled out should the Leafs go a couple of rounds … Via the team’s public relations department from the closed practice at Ford Performance Centre, all lines and defence pairings remain the same, with Robertson on left wing with Alex Kerfoot and Kasperi Kapanen. Pierre Engvall remains the extra forward. Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Toronto SUN, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

The Maple Leafs defeated the Coyotes 3-1. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The experiment between the   hasn’t go as planned. Barrie was underutilized by Mike Babcock but did have a pretty good season once the Leafs changed coaches. He may not have met expectations, however, that could all change when the post-season begins in a few days. When the Leafs acquired Barrie and Alex Kerfoot in the   they hoped they would be receiving this type of player below.

Instead, they were hoping for a player who could control the puck and be a huge asset to his offensively gifted teammates. Toronto Maple Leafs Womens Family Holiday Pajamas - XL When you pair an offense-first defenseman in Barrie with the skill of Auston Matthews, William Nylander, John Tavares and Mitch Marner, you’d expect to see a lot of stretch passes and offensive chances like that video above. Unfortunately, he’s had his worst offensive season as a professional, so when his offense isn’t working, it shines a negative light on the 29-year-old. Barrie is going to play on the third pairing with Travis Dermott and deserves to be a bottom pairing defenseman at this current moment. However, I wouldn’t be shocked if that pairing turned into one of the better duos the Leafs have. Barrie has seen a lot of criticism this season, but a lot of blame can be put on Mike Babcock. Babcock put him in a tough situation and didn’t allow him to play the free-flowing game he naturally plays, so when Sheldon Keefe was hired, Barrie’s game drastically improved. Barrie has a career average of 0.62 points per game, so under Keefe you can see that he went back to his regular point totals.  ( ). If Barrie had played at the same pace for the entire season, he would have finished with nine goals and 56 points, which would have been his third best points season in nine NHL seasons. Not only has Barrie improved drastically under Keefe, but his shooting percentage is the lowest it’s ever been in the NHL. Barrie has a 3.0 shooting percentage this season, compared to his career average of 6.5 percent. I haven’t broken down every single shot attempt he’s had this season, but with 554 games as a sample size, you have to think that he was snake-bitten and that average is bound to rise. If Barrie’s shooting percentage was equal to an average year, he would have finished with double-digit goals and the criticism probably wouldn’t have been so bad. When you play in a city that loves you for eight seasons, it’s hard to adapt to a new team and play at your highest level in year one, especially under a coach that didn’t let him fly. Now that Barrie has found his groove under Keefe and is 13 months removed from being traded, I would expect him to perform at a high-level. Playing on the third-pairing will be a good spot for him, as he won’t have to eat up huge defensive minutes like Morgan Rielly and Jake Muzzin, but he’ll still be able to contribute on the power-play. Also by being paired with Travis Dermott, who is also an offensive-defenseman,  the two of them should be able to move the puck up the ice quickly, creating more rushes in the offensive zone, compared to being trapped in their own end. The last and arguably the most important reason why Barrie will perform at a high-level this post-season is because he’s an Unrestricted Free Agent this off-season. After being traded to the  , Barrie experienced huge pressure to perform and rise his contract stock. Now that his stock is low after a below-average season, Barrie will need to use this playoff run (no matter how long it takes) as an audition to teams to sign him to a big deal. Barrie had a slow-start that stopped any momentum for a monster contract, so he’ll be even more motivated to perform when the Leafs return to action on August 2. I hope I’m right about Barrie because if he can perform to his potential, it would give a huge boost to a mediocre defensive-core.        Newsletter   Your Toronto Maple Leafs.  Your Inbox.

Following Toronto's 2-0 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets in Game 1 of their qualifying-round series, Simmons asked Matthews for his thoughts on the Blue Jackets' tight-checking style of play. The American forward took Simmons to task before answering the question. ""Well, first of all, I mean it's unfortunate that I'm getting a question from you at this point, Steve, but I just wanted to say I didn't really appreciate the article that you wrote about me a couple months ago. I thought it was a bit unethical, to be honest,"" Matthews said. ""But moving along,"" he added before addressing Simmons' query.  Here is the full media availability with Morgan Rielly and Auston Matthews following the Leafs’ 2-0 loss to the Blue Jackets  — 𝐃𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐝 𝐀𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫 (@dalter)   Simmons addressed Matthews' comments on Twitter shortly thereafter:  For the record, I have no problem with what Auston Matthews said tonight. He's not a journalist. He's a pro athlete. If we weren't in this COVID situation, I'm sure we would have had the conversation face to face long before this. — steve simmons (@simmonssteve)   Simmons reported on June 19 that Matthews had tested positive and was in quarantine in his home state of Arizona. The Maple Leafs stated in response to the report that ""a person's medical information in this regard is private"" and declined to comment further, citing the NHL's policy regarding the publication of test results. Matthews confirmed the report a few weeks later but said he was feeling fully healthy ahead of training camp. "

Rielly led all National Hockey League defencemen with 20 goals last season and finished fifth in Norris Trophy voting. But this season he struggled to produce at the same level while playing through a nagging injury. And then on Jan. 12 he broke his foot during a game in Florida, missing eight weeks of action and only returning for the final game before the pandemic pause. If Tuesday night was any indication, the 26-year-old looks ready to reclaim his top form. ""He really did skate well,"" coach Sheldon Keefe observed after the 4-2 exhibition win over Montreal. ""Mo is at his best when he is flying up the rink and joining the rush and playing with authority. Talking to him, he is feeling as good as he's felt from a health standpoint and he looked like it with how he skated."" Rielly finished the only tune-up game before the qualifying round series with a shorthanded goal, two assists and four shots on net while logging 19 minutes of ice time.  ""If you were looking at what you would want to come out of this game for someone like Mo, it's the confidence to be up and skating and pushing the pace with the way that he moves and joins the rush,"" Keefe said. ""He got rewarded with a goal and that's great to see."" For his part, Rielly, who finished the regular season with 27 points in 47 games, didn't want to get carried away when asked to assess his progress. ""A break like that, I mean, players had a chance to do what they needed to for their body, I don't think I was any different,"" he said. “It's nice to be out there after a long break, for sure, I think we all feel that.""  After tough regular season, Leafs' Rielly looking like his old self.  has more:    — TSN (@TSN_Sports)  --- While Rielly's return helps bolster the blue-line, Keefe has stressed that Toronto's forwards have to do a better job of helping keep the puck out of the net. And the coach liked the progress he saw against the Canadiens. ""We moved our feet really well,"" Keefe said. ""Defensively, I thought that was a big thing for us. We want to make sure that we are really working and skating and having urgency coming back to our end. I thought that was a really good sign for our team. There were a number of times we came back. I thought we gave up the neutral zone at times a little too easily, but I liked how we worked. We ended up breaking up some plays in and around our net because of the work we had coming back. That was really good."" ""We're doing well,"" said winger  . ""I don't think we gave up too much last game. I think every day, every practice we get a little bit better. [It] was really important for us to jump into game-like situations where there was randomness and things like that and I thought we adapted well and it's a good for us moving forward."" But no one is getting too carried away after one exhibition game against the lowest seed in the Eastern Conference field. ""It's definitely a work in progress,"" said defenceman  . ""We did a lot of good things last night, executed a lot of what Sheldon emphasized through training camp, but I also think one game isn't going to be the [sign] that we made it so I think there's still a lot of stuff we can continue to clean up and continue to emphasize."" --- Rielly isn't the only Vancouver native who appears poised to turn things around after a forgettable regular season. Alex Kerfoot scored twice on Tuesday and appears much more comfortable after a shaky start to his Leafs tenure. Kerfoot bounced between centre and wing much of the year, but now with Ilya Mikheyev returning from injury, Keefe has been able to slot the 25-year-old in as the third-line centre alongside wingers   and Nick Robertson. ""It was as good as we have seen Kerfoot play and that's a really healthy sign for our team,"" Keefe raved after Tuesday’s game. ""If we can get Kappy and Kerf playing like they were [Tuesday], it makes us a tough team to handle. That's really good for us.” With other teams focused on shutting down Toronto's top two forward lines, production from the bottom of the lineup could swing a tight series. One of Kerfoot's goals on Tuesday came while the Leafs were short-handed. Kerfoot has never played a consistent PK role during his NHL career, but while watching video during the pandemic pause the coaching staff liked the potential he showed in spot duty. ""[Assistant coach] Dave Hakstol really took the lead with that,"" Keefe noted. ""We had used him sparingly and just looking a lot closer at it and thought there were a lot of positives there that gave us reason to want to give him a chance early in camp to expand his role. It helps us having a centre who can take face-offs."" Toronto's top forward penalty killers in the regular season – Mitch Marner, Hyman, Mikheyev, Kapanen and   – are all wingers. But Kerfoot won't simply be darting off the ice after winning face-offs. ""How he skates and pressures the puck and his reads of the play have been really good so we've seen lots of reasons to continue to go with that,"" Keefe noted. ""And if he can continue to pair with Kappy like he did yesterday and they play together at five-on-five and can go together on the kill, it really helps the rhythm of our bench."" The Leafs' penalty kill was a big reason why they lost the last two series against the Bruins, allowing 14 goals in the 14 games. So, it's important that the unit builds some confidence heading into this best-of-five series against the Jackets.  ""Our PK was solid last night,"" said Hyman. ""Kerf and Kappy did a great job. Kerf on that draw was great and he scored a shorthanded goal and they didn't give up much. Both quick and fast on pucks and they were really strong. It was good for us to have them going."" --- Kerfoot suggested that poor ice conditions at Scotiabank Arena helped the Leafs kill off Montreal's six power plays on Tuesday. ""The ice was sloppy,"" he said. ""It was hard to make plays."" The Leafs-Habs game was the second of the day in the building and the temperature was in the high 20s leading up to puck drop. ""Under the circumstances they were pretty good,""   said of the ice conditions. ""There was a game before so that's something that will be interesting to see how it plays out. The ice crew has a p​retty tough task ahead of them with a lot of games in a short period of time.""  Puck bouncing like crazy. Second game of the day in Toronto. Going to be such a challenge in humid, hot Toronto to get that ice ok throughout the tournament. Only thing that helps is no crowd so doors in the rink can stay closed for the most part and keep the humidity out a bit. — Pierre LeBrun (@PierreVLeBrun)  ---  shifted to the right side to skate a few shifts alongside Rielly in the third period on Tuesday. The lefty also skated on his off-side during some of the Phase 2 workouts and for one of the scrimmages in the Phase 3 training camp. What does Keefe think of the Rielly-Dermott pairing? ""They've done fine,"" he said. ""I don’t know that the sample is large enough yet to make any real final determinations, but what we've seen throughout this with the number of reps we were able to get Derms playing on the right side and practising on the right side, he's comfortable to play there any time we want to make a change. It gives us increased flexibility and gives him further opportunity to move up the line-up."" Rielly and Dermott only played together for 25 minutes and 34 seconds this season, per Natural StatTrick, making them the least used pair on the Leafs. --- Robertson remained on the third line at practice on Wednesday. He’s now skated in a regular spot in the top-12 in every team session since July 18. What are we to read into that?  ""What you can read into it is we continue to believe in him and he hasn't had any lapses here that have made us second guess giving him that opportunity,"" said Keefe. ""Despite the fact we don't have any more games here, we haven't made any final decisions. We still have some days here to consider different things ... If you can read anything into it, it's just we continue to believe in him and believe there's reason to give him reps in that spot."" The 18-year-old spoke to the media on Wednesday, his second session with reporters since camp opened up. ""My confidence level is obviously getting higher and higher each day,"" Robertson said. ""Getting to know the players off the ice definitely helps on the ice and just learning a lot from all these guys and asking a lot of questions helps me."" Robertson played just over 10 minutes against the Habs, firing one shot on net and picking up a secondary assist.

From the Branches Though you may not have guessed it from the first game the Leafs played.  It’s not just “work out the wording of your apology to your fans in advance”.  Coaches including Bruce Cassidy and Sheldon Keefe share their perspective on life inside the bubble. In a fun attempt to keep some traditions going despite the lack of fans in the audience, NHL staff threw hats on the ice to celebrate  ’s hat trick earlier this week, resulting in possibly the most McDavid quote of all time...  ""I found the hats unnecessary, just drop the puck and keep on going"" - Connor McDavid  — Brennan Klak (@nhlupdate)   The TL;DR is exactly the argument I’d make when saying that the Leafs should want the Lightning: our play styles are very complimentary of each other.

Image description text   After breaking down the  , it’s time to move East and check out the   and  . The Leafs and Habs enter the qualifying round in very different scenarios; Montreal as the lowest-placed team just lucky to be here at all, and Toronto facing a lot of pressure to finally have some playoff success after three years of first round exit “learning experiences.” Before we break down the biggest strengths and weaknesses for both teams, let’s look at how each of them fared at controlling play in the second half of the season. Unlike the West where three of the four teams really struggled to control play at 5-on-5, both the Canadiens and Leafs were very strong even strength teams during the second half of the regular season. Toronto was the only team in Canada to register positive differentials in all these shot quality measures, while Montreal registered huge advantages in shots, but struggled when it came to controlling slot passes. Ironically, that’s Toronto’s biggest strength. Even with a glaring weakness in passing, both teams were very strong overall in the regular season, so where are they exploitable? WEAKNESSES The Canadiens’ biggest weakness was extremely evident in their exhibition game against the Maple Leafs on Tuesday night. Granted, it was the first game in nearly five months for both teams, but the Canadiens have a remarkably difficult time getting from their own zone to the offensive zone on the power play.  That happens to be an issue at even strength as well, and though the Canadiens aren’t the absolute league worst in that area at evens, they’re not far off it. For a team built around speed and depth, it’s somewhat remarkable how bad they are at transitioning the puck. The other area that plagues the Canadiens structurally also has to do with their special teams, where they allow the second-most chances against of any team in the league — and those chances also have the highest proportion of screens of any team.  Combine the special teams struggles with Carey Price’s up and down season at 5-on-5 and it’s easy to see why a seemingly stellar even strength team could never cut the mustard this season. For the Leafs,   that they’re relatively excellent at stopping teams at their defensive blue line, but if that neutral zone defence is penetrated, they’re awful. No team had a higher proportion of their controlled entries against turn into scoring chances off the rush, so we’ve got a situation where the Leafs are legitimately good at holding their blue line, but it hasn’t translated to good defence at all. It’s truly strange. The other two biggest weaknesses for the Leafs are going to send the people who say the team needs to get bigger and grittier into a tizzy, because there’s some legitimacy to that. Maybe not necessarily getting bigger, but the Leafs genuinely struggle at removing possession from opponents in the neutral and defensive zones. They can intercept passes and pounce on mistakes as well as any team, but in actual physical confrontations they’re among the league’s worst. STRENGTHS Once the Canadiens do gain the offensive zone at even strength, they’re a buzzsaw in the crease. Brendan Gallagher is the keystone player, but the whole team drives the inner slot constantly, and their ability to win battles and get to loose pucks before opponents after a shot creates more possession time in the offensive zone and more dangerous shots. Unfortunately for the Canadiens, that hasn’t translated into them being a top notch even strength scoring team. Whether it’s due to a lack of pre-shot movement or simply not enough high-level shooters in the lineup, it seems like there are far too many wasted golden opportunities. It can make them a frustrating team to watch if you want to see wins. The Leafs are in many ways the funhouse mirror of the Habs. While the Canadiens struggle to move the puck in transition, no team goes from their own zone to the attack more efficiently than the Leafs. They don’t get as much volume of chances as the Canadiens do, but their combination of elite snipers like Auston Matthews, and killer playmakers like Mitch Marner, makes them one of the league’s scariest teams to deal with.  The Leafs hit the offensive zone fast and hard, and the puck is rarely stuck going north-south. The entire ice is utilized in the attack to get everyone moving and create lanes for passes through the middle. Their ability to score their way out of trouble makes some believe they play lazy at times, but I think they just lean into the strengths of their roster more often than not.

""I wish nothing but the best for that guy,"" Tortorella said earlier this week. ""Other than this series."" When Keefe coaches the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Qualifiers against the Columbus Blue Jackets in Toronto on Sunday (8 p.m. ET; NHLN, SN, TVAS, FS-O), he will be opposed by Tortorella, his coach for 93 of his 125 games as an NHL forward. ""Playing for him as a young guy was difficult,"" said Keefe, who was 20 years old his first season under Tortorella. ""He made it tough to earn your way as a young player, and I was caught up in that, but certainly as I made the transition from playing to being a coach and I started thinking about what I valued and how I was going to put together a program, that's when you really learn to respect the process of how John put together a team concept."" Keefe played for Tortorella in three seasons with the Tampa Bay Lightning, from 2001-2003. The 39-year-old said the experience played a big role in forming his philosophy and vision as a coach. ""Especially as you look back on it -- I didn't get to play on that Stanley Cup championship team in Tampa in 2004 -- but I was there through the process of that team growing from one year to the next to the next, eventually to the point where it was too good for me to play on,"" Keefe said July 16. ""That process and seeing how he put all that together to eventually build it to a champion, frankly, has been a foundation of my coaching since I started with Pembroke at the junior A level."" The Maple Leafs are the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference Qualifiers, and the Blue Jackets are the No. 9 seed. They will face each other in one of four best-of-5 series at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, the East's hub city. The winner will advance to the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and the loser will have a chance at the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NHL Draft in the Second Phase of the NHL Draft Lottery, to be held Aug. 10. Keefe is attempting to guide Toronto from being a team with elite young talent to one that consistently contends for the Stanley Cup. It is a situation like the one Tortorella, now 62, faced when he replaced Steve Ludzik as Tampa Bay coach 39 games into the 2000-01 season. Keefe was the same age as forwards Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards, who were integral to the Lightning's Stanley Cup championship team. He is looking to help Maple Leafs forwards  , 22,  , 23, and  , 24, each maximize his ability like Tortorella did with Lecavalier and Richards. ""Just how John handled young players and elite young players, I remember,"" Keefe said. ""… John was a big part of shaping their careers and having success with him."" When Keefe was promoted from Toronto of the American Hockey League to replace Mike Babcock as Maple Leafs coach Nov. 20, 2019, his former coach was one of the people who reached out to him. ""I got a nice note from John when I got this job and was promoted up with the Leafs, and I'm very grateful for that,"" Keefe said. ""I learned a lot from John and have been fortunate to reconnect over the last few years."" Although Keefe did not have a long NHL playing career, Tortorella said he noticed how hard he competed. ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for that guy,"" Tortorella said. ""He's one of the most competitive players I've coached. I didn't coach him a lot of games. But when he played, he knew one way, and that was to play hard."" Now, Keefe, who has 27 NHL coaching wins and is entering his first postseason experience in the League, said he intends to show respect for Tortorella, 14th in NHL history with 655 wins, by the way he will have the Maple Leafs prepared to compete. ""I'm ready. The one thing about Torts is he is an ultimate competitor, and I'd like to believe I'm a competitor at the same time,"" Keefe said. ""The greatest way to show respect is to make sure you are ready to compete. So that will be all you'll hear from me in terms of talking about John and our past. I'm just going to focus on getting our team ready to compete, that's the greatest way to show someone respect.""   Share this!!

Image description text   TORONTO — Nineteen wins for No. 19. That’s what stands between   and an elusive Stanley Cup. Of course, you don’t get as deep into your career as the   forward without learning about the value of staying in the moment. Especially entering the playoffs. “One step at a time,” Spezza said on a recent Zoom call with reporters, when the topic of a potential storybook finish to this strange season was raised. Spezza is a compelling figure at the dawn of a qualifying-round series with Columbus. It was this specific opportunity that prompted the 37-year-old to take a hometown discount while signing with his hometown team, and the unprecedented circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have since forced him to leave wife Jennifer and their four daughters at home while moving into the NHL bubble a short drive away. Throughout hockey’s pause Spezza has “stepped up,” in the words of Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe, taking an active role in the return-to-play discussions with the NHL Players’ Association and becoming an even more trusted voice among teammates. “He’s a veteran player in the league and he’s experienced a lot of different things. And he’s a guy that’s passionate about the game and he’s also passionate about  his  game and  his  career and having another shot to compete for the Cup,” said Keefe. Spezza has lived a full hockey life: As the much-hyped prospect who once made his playoff debut in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Final, as the No. 1 centre on a team that fell short in the Stanley Cup Final, as the well-travelled veteran still finding a way to contribute to a post-season run despite a limited role, and many other things in between. That’s why the Leafs measure his impact by much more than goals and assists. It should come as no surprise, for example, that Spezza made it a point to speak with 18-year-old Nick Robertson at least once per day during summer training camp or that he stayed out well after a recent practice to feed Robertson passes for extra work on his one-timer. “He’s one of the most caring guys you’ll meet,” Ben Bishop, Spezza’s former teammate in Dallas, said earlier this season. “If there’s a rookie that comes up from the minors, Spezz is the first one to go sit next to him and talk hockey.” There are two things that keep Spezza coming to the rink with a smile on his face each day no matter what personal circumstances he may be dealing with: 1. A child-like love for the game 2. A burning desire to lift the Stanley Cup And not necessarily in that order. On the topic of the Cup, he can serve as something of a cautionary tale for 22-year-old Auston Matthews, 23-year-old Mitch Marner and 24-year-old William Nylander. Spezza played in Game 7 of the 2003 Eastern Conference Final before his 20th birthday and was Marner’s age when he helped the Ottawa Senators reach the Cup Final four years later. The Senators were a force with him, Daniel Alfredsson and Dany Heatley each in their primes together. And yet they never managed to be the last team standing. “He really just is a great voice within our team through his experience, and not all positive experiences,” said Keefe. “I played on great teams early on and you think they’re going to last forever and then you realize that things change,” Spezza said in September. “Those three years we had there [in Ottawa], we were knocking on the door and probably should have won. We were a perennial powerhouse for a few years and didn’t get it done. You don’t want to see that happen again.” As for what he might contribute now, know this: Back in the weeks before he’d even played his first game with the Leafs, Spezza was already talking about the role a fourth line can take on in the playoffs. He’d scored a couple big goals during Dallas’ run to the second round in 2019 and pointed to how Boston and St. Louis — the most recent Cup finalists — each found strength from the bottom part of their rosters. “I think when you get to the end you need it,” he said. So under these most unusual of circumstances Spezza will try to help tip the scales in Toronto’s favour. As a steadying hand, sounding board and dressing room dad. As a depth forward who will give it all he’s got for each precious shift Keefe gives him. More than 17 years into his NHL career, Spezza is all-in on this restart. He will make do with regular FaceTime calls with daughters Sophia, Nicola, Anna and Julia, and adjust a pre-game routine that can no longer include a stroll through the city to grab a coffee. And he will savour an opportunity decades in the making. “Obviously being in Toronto would be extra special to win because of the support we get from the city and me growing up here,” said Spezza. “I’m definitely chasing a dream. “To try to win a Stanley Cup as a Maple Leaf is something that I dreamed of as a kid.”                                     You can change your selections at any time.

The NHL season was paused March 12 due to concerns surrounding the coronavirus. Under the Return to Play Plan, 24 teams will compete for the Stanley Cup -- 12 in the Eastern Conference, in Toronto, 12 in the Western Conference, in Edmonton  --  starting  Saturday. Today, a look at the three teams that can expect the biggest boost from their power play in the Qualifiers.   Edmonton Oilers The Oilers had the top-ranked power play in the NHL this season at 29.5 percent, the best in the League since the New York Islanders in 1978-79 (31.2 percent). Edmonton forwards   (44) and   (43) were first and second in the NHL in power-play points, and forward   was tied for sixth with 12 power-play goals. The Oilers, the No. 5 seed in the West, likely will need their power play to continue to produce at an elite rate to have the advantage against the Chicago Blackhawks, the No. 12 seed, during their best-of-5 Stanley Cup Qualifier series, which starts at Rogers Place on Saturday (3 p.m. ET; NBC, SN). Chicago's penalty kill was ninth in the NHL at 82.1 percent. One potential point of concern for the Blackhawks is that goalie   had an .852 save percentage when facing opposing power plays, 38th among goalies to play at least 20 games this season.   Vancouver Canucks The Canucks were fourth on the power play at 24.2 percent after finishing 22nd (17.1 percent) in 2018-19. Much of that improvement can be credited to the addition of forward  , who was acquired in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning on June 22, 2019, and the impact of rookie defenseman  . Miller and Hughes tied for the team lead with 25 power-play points, followed by center   with 24. Forward   led the Canucks with 12 power-play goals. The Canucks also should have a healthy   in the lineup for the start of their qualifier series against the Minnesota Wild. Boeser scored five power-play goals in 57 games; the forward missed 12 of the Canucks' final 13 games before the season was paused because of a rib injury but is healthy now. The Canucks, the No. 7 seed in the West, will play the Wild, the No. 10 seed, in a best-of-5 Cup Qualifier series at Rogers Place beginning Sunday (10:30 p.m. ET; NBCSN, NHL.TV, SN, FS-N, FS-WI). The Wild were 25th on the penalty kill this season at 77.2 percent, and their ability to defend against Vancouver's power play could be affected by which goalie plays.   had an .865 save percentage against opposing power plays, which was 33rd in the NHL among goalies to play at least 20 games, and   had an .844 save percentage, which was 45th. Rookie  , who played five games, had a .706 save percentage against opposing power plays.   Toronto Maple Leafs The Maple Leafs were sixth on the power play at 23.1 percent. Center   led Toronto with 25 power-play points in 70 games and forward   was second with 24 in 59 games. The Maple Leafs, the No. 8 seed in the East, will play the Columbus Blue Jackets, the No. 9 seed, in a best-of-5 Cup Qualifier series that starts at Scotiabank Arena on Sunday (8 p.m. ET; NHLN, SN, TVAS, FS-O). One way the Maple Leafs could maximize their success on the power play is to start defenseman   on the No. 1 unit rather than defenseman  . Barrie scored 12 power-play points in 70 games, which led Maple Leafs defensemen. Rielly scored seven power-play points in 47 games; he missed 23 of the Maple Leafs' final 24 games before the season pause with a foot injury but is expected to be in the lineup against the Blue Jackets. Barrie averaged 3.86 power-play points per 60 minutes this season compared to Rielly's 3.82, so a top unit of Barrie along with forwards Matthews, Marner,   and   could be Toronto's most effective group. The Maple Leafs will need to be at their best on the power play against the Blue Jackets, who were 12th on the penalty kill (81.7 percent) and should have defenseman   in the lineup. Jones, who led the Blue Jackets in total shorthanded ice time (135:23), hasn't played since having ankle surgery Feb. 11. He missed the final 14 games before the season pause, and without him the Blue Jackets' penalty kill was 73.9 percent, 26th in the NHL.   Share this!!

I could have understood the debate at the beginning of next season on whether or not Robertson should be in the line-up, but at this current stage, there’s no better option. If   enough to play, we wouldn’t be having this debate, but he’s not. Let’s take a look at the other wingers (regardless of left or right side) that could replace  , not named Johnnson. Petan has played 129 career NHL games, but only 34 in the past two seasons. At 25-years-old, it’s pretty clear the type of player that Petan is. He’s a tweener. Toronto Maple Leafs Toddler Family Holiday Pajamas - 2T What that exactly means is that he’s too good for the American Hockey League, but not quite strong enough for the National Hockey League. At 5-foot-9, 175 pounds, he’s able to get away with a few more things in the AHL compared to NHL, and over the past few seasons he’s been been an exceptional AHL-player. Averaging over a point-per-game in his past two AHL seasons, Petan is the type of player that will be a career AHLer if he plays in Toronto’s system for a while, because their forward depth is so good. In order for him to become an everyday NHL player, he’ll have to do so on a below-average team. In my opinion, if things go well, he could be on a similar career path as Brendan Leipsic (who’s name I hate to say, because of  ) from a hockey-perspective. Leipsic was a very good AHL-player but could never crack the Toronto Maple Leafs roster but the expansion draft kick-started his NHL career, and before we found out he was a terrible person, was playing very well in Washington this year. No offense to Petan, but we already know the type of player he is, and Robertson is a better fit than him for the playoffs. We all know Kyle Dubas loves undersized players, and Malgin fits that mold perfectly. Listed at 5-foot-9 (just like Robertson) and only a few pounds heavier, Malgin is a very similar type of player as Robertson body-wise. Traded from Florida in the Mason Marchment deal earlier this year, Malgin only appeared in eight regular season games before the stoppage. Although he didn’t register a point in those eight games, he was a serviceable player. He only had three shots on net in those eight games, so it’s pretty hard to score when you’re barely shooting the puck. With an above average career shooting percentage of 10.8 percent, Malgin’s always been known as a player that doesn’t shoot the puck enough, and you can’t have that on this third-line. Alex Kerfoot and Kasperi Kapanen can generate offense on a line, but in order for them to be even more successful, they could use a pure-sniper on the wing with them, and Malgin just isn’t that player. Malgin is a good depth player and if injuries come up, he can jump in the line-up and not make mistakes, whereas Robertson could be a difference-maker. I’m not saying that Robertson is is going to register a point every night, but he’s a great option to replace Johnsson. You don’t score over 50 goals in the Ontario Hockey League by accident, so Robertson knows how to score and has a very high Hockey IQ. Just look at his hard work below, en route to a Alex Kerfoot goal. He’s already fitting in nicely. Full sequence on that last goal, Robertson is good.  — Ah yes, the Leafs. (@LeafsAllDayy)  It shocked me that people actually debated and argued at whether or not Robertson should make the Leafs roster and play. I mean, would you rather have Malgin or Petan instead of the upside of Robertson? It’s not even a debate in my opinion. Also, it’s not like we’re debating the first-line or top power-play. We’re talking about a third-line player that’s going to play anywhere between 10-13 minutes a night. The Toronto Maple Leafs could put a pylon on this line and have more than enough offense, but when you have the ability to add more fire-power, you do it. I’m not expecting the world from the 18-year-old, but I am excited to see him play. Maybe he can pull off some rookie-magic with an over-time goal like his line-mate Kapanen did during his first playoffs as well.        Newsletter   Your Toronto Maple Leafs.  Your Inbox. Every Day.

2020-07-31 14:38:43.825722,https://thehockeywriters.com/maple-leafs-nick-robertson-progress-potential/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjDgf_y2oTrAhVKE4gKHZ3MDRM4FBDRjwUwA3oECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw0zpkK1oPIFqIhn2vAe0nEX,"             If you’re not a Toronto Maple Leafs fan but you’ve heard the name Nick Robertson emerge in a postseason hockey conversations, here’s the backstory. The Maple Leafs drafted Robertson in the second round (53 rd  overall) of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He was the youngest player in the draft because of his Sept. 11 birthday (four days before the draft cut-off date of Sept. 15). He put on a show with the OHL’s Peterborough Petes this season scoring 86 points (including 55 goals) in 46 games. He was dominant and was the only player in the OHL to average over a goal per game. Nicholas Robertson, Toronto Maple Leafs, 2019 NHL Draft (  / The Hockey Writers) Robertson also played for Team USA at the World Junior Hockey Championships and, to no surprise, he also averaged a point-per-game pace. In addition to his stellar play and as a young player with character, he was awarded the William Hanley Memorial Trophy as the OHL’s most sportsmanlike player. In fact, Robertson displayed so much talent and maturity as an 18-year-old that he earned a callup to the Maple Leafs’ return-to-play training camp. Although most pundits believed he was along for the experience and preparing for the future, he played well and – at least so far – earned a spot among the top-nine forwards in the starting lineup. Robertson played his first NHL game on Tuesday night. Although it was an exhibition game, he played a regular shift throughout. The Maple Leafs beat their original-six rival the Montreal Canadiens 4-2, and Robertson even found the score sheet, recording an assist on Alex Kerfoot’s second goal of the game. Overall, he looked good on the third line and played about 10 minutes. Because his linemates Kasperi Kapanen and Kerfoot were deployed in regular penalty-killing roles, that limited his ice time – not a bad thing for his first taste of the NHL. Overall, the third line looked dangerous in limited time during the game. Alexander Kerfoot, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) From my perspective, Robertson was into the game physically from the beginning but looked better as the game progressed. He made mistakes, and at times lost the puck to bigger and more experienced Canadiens players. No surprise, there’s a learning curve for the diminutive 18-year-old and some things still need to be figured out and improved. If nothing changes during the next couple of days of practice, Robertson will probably continue to play on the third line. He earned more minutes than both Pierre Engvall and Frederik Gauthier combined during the game, and that might be telling – or it might not. Both Engvall and Gauthier are quality players and head coach Sheldon Keefe knows what he will get from them. During Wednesday’s practice, Robertson remained in the same spot on the third line. Because the first real game of the postseason is fast approaching, it seems he will likely start Game 1 of the qualifying round against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday, Aug. 2. In a , Keefe was asked about Robertson’s comment after the game that he,  Felt like last night proved to himself that he can keep up at this level.” Keefe responded I think he (Robertson) is in a good place there. He is not a guy that is short on confidence. He has shown that all the way throughout the camp that he believes in himself. He goes out every shift and tries to make the most of it in every rep in practice. That is what you like about him.” Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe talks to captain John Tavares (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young) About his play during the exhibition game, Keefe noted that Robertson showed “some really good, positive signs in his play. That was another level of competition than what we were going through in camp now that you are playing against a real opponent. He showed well in that sense. That was a positive thing to see from him.” Despite the many positives form his first exhibition game, there are questions about whether Robertson is ready for postseason prime-time. Yesterday,   noted that he faced trouble along the boards when he engaged physically with bigger and more experienced opponents. Bourne also pointed out some of the difficulties smaller, younger players must overcome to find NHL success. Specifically, he noted that smaller NHL as stars like Mitch Marner and the Chicago Blackhawks’ Patrick Kane succeed because they don’t check and that “they can’t even be touched.” However, because Robertson seeks to engage physically, he needs to improve that aspect of his game.  Bourne’s critique has less to do Robertson’s eventual NHL success and is more a question about how he might hold up against the Blue Jackets’ physical defense. He noted that Roberson is an 18-year-old tenacious and hard-working player. He’s got a heavy shot and he’s hungry. But he also points out that he’s 5-foot-9 and inexperienced. Furthermore, he faces a similar problem that any young talent faces in the NHL. There’s a huge learning curve that can get beaten into you, which is especially true during the playoffs. Because Robertson’s an engager and – unlike Marner and Kane – doesn’t “exist in the seams,” even when he engages ferociously, sometimes raw size still wins. Mitch Marner, Toronto Maple Leafs (  / The Hockey Writers) Bourne believes Robertson will grow into a good NHL player “one day,” but it might not be this postseason. Instead, he reminds Maple Leafs fans that “hockey is still very much a contact sport, and playoff hockey is another animal yet. There’s grabbing and pulling and huge people playing at their competitive best.” Bourne’s assessment is that during the playoffs Robertson needs to sit. He believes Engvall and Gauthier will give the Maple Leafs a better chance of moving forward. He notes, “Engvall is huge and skates like the wind. Gauthier wins draws and defends as a priority.” All this being said, Keefe has the last line change. He’s had four months of a COVID-19-induced “offseason,” and he’s video-binged his team and has made some decisions about the way he wants them to play. After a successful Phase 3 training camp, it looks like Robertson is part of his plan heading into the best-of-five series. So far. When asked in yesterday’s interview if he had made any decisions in terms of what he would do with Robertson during Sunday’s Game 1, Keefe replied: What you can read into it is that we continue to believe in him. He hasn’t had any lapses here that have made us second-guess giving him that opportunity. Despite the fact that we don’t have any more games here, we haven’t made any final decisions. I still have some days here to consider some different things.” Nick Robertson, Peterborough Petes (Luke Durda/OHL Images) It’s an interesting situation for Keefe and the Maple Leafs regarding the team’s youngest player and future star. Whatever choice is made will be the target of continuous scrutiny and debate. Will Robertson improve as he did in his small taste of NHL action, or will he be overwhelmed by the Blue Jackets’ size and experience? The upside is that Keefe has the last decision. He’s the coach and he has the last line change.   start:tags     end:tags    start:article footer     end:article footer         Ezoic - BottomNative - native_bottom    placeholder 111 blocked.

You'll have to wing it a little bit."" Tavares isn't really the 'wing it' kind of guy. He's all about preparation and details and being ready. But playing professional hockey in a pandemic is going to be unlike anything anyone has seen before.  ""You'll have to continue to adapt and expect the unpredictable and just be able to deal with it,"" said Tavares, who will turn 30 in September. ""If there are certain games that go into overtimes and push the start times later that's something you've never dealt with before, so there's a possibility for a lot of different things. You just have be very open-minded and adjust on the fly and deal with those circumstances."" The Leafs didn't always handle adversity well during a roller-coaster regular season that saw Mike Babcock fired, injuries to key players and generally inconsistent play.  ""We have to deal with the momentum swings that you see in playoff series better than we handled some things in the regular season,"" Tavares admitted.   Finish Phase 3 strong ðŸ’ª    â€” Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  In uncertain times, Tavares believes his teammates understand the opportunity at hand.  ""Pandemic's given [us] perspective on a lot of different things,"" he said. ""We know what a lot of people are going through, what the world's going through, society, and to be able to do this, have a chance to complete this season, continue to compete and chase the Stanley Cup, there's nothing better than that."" The Leafs players will report to the practice facility on Sunday morning to undergo COVID-19 testing, but then they will have the afternoon off to spend with family and make final preparations for what they hope will be the longest and strangest road trip of their lives. The team will re-assemble at night and take a bus to the Fairmont Royal York.  Sheldon Keefe, like Tavares, wasn't packed as of Saturday afternoon.  ""My wife has helped to really set aside a lot of things for me to be able to choose from,"" Keefe revealed with a smile. ""It's going to be a challenge for me to not overpack and keep it simple and make sure I've got the things I need. I do tend to overpack for a lot of road trips just to give myself options but I want to stay a little bit lighter in this case and not over think it."" It's easy to overthink things these days and so Keefe's message to the team echoes that of his captain.  ""Expect the unexpected and be comfortable being uncomfortable,"" said Keefe, who will turn 40 in September. ""That's a big part of it here. We just have to take things as they come, not complain, just keep our head down and continue to work and be as prepared as possible, as focused as possible for the challenge ahead ... We've put in the work here over the last couple of weeks â€“ and even further back if you look at Phase 2 â€“ to be as prepared as we can be for the physical demands of what's to come. The mental part of it now, we've just got to remain focused on what we can control."" From espresso machines to video game consoles and plenty of underwear, NHLers tell Mark Masters what their 'must haves' are to bring inside the NHL's bubble. --- One wonders what is going through the head of Nick Robertson, who has never played an NHL game, but once again found himself skating on Torontoâ€™s third line at Saturdayâ€™s practice. Afterwards, Keefe laid out a litmus test the 18-year-old must pass in Tuesday's lone exhibition game if the Peterborough Pete hopes to crack the Game 1 lineup.  ""He needs to look comfortable,"" Keefe said. ""He needs to make an impact on the game, be it through his work ethic and enthusiasm or his ability to create some offence and capitalize when he gets chances. All those kinds of things. Really looking to see, can he look like himself and be able to play what I suspect is going [to be] the highest level, highest calibre of game that he's played in? ... Weâ€™re just really looking to see if he can be comfortable and be himself and then see how it all sorts itself out in terms our other players."" The other players battling for that last forward spot appear to be   and  . At Saturday's practice, Engvall skated between   and   on the fourth line while Gauthier was the 13th forward.  â€œWe're just trying to keep all our options open,"" Keefe said. ""So between Engvall and Spezza we wanted to get them some reps at centre ice and playing low in the defensive zone and those types of responsibilities that come with it. We want to remain as flexible as possible and remain as prepared as possible for any decision that we might make.""  Leafs Ice Chips: Robertson's challenge is clear.  has MORE:    â€” TSN (@TSN_Sports)  ---  is getting ready for the playoffs and also to be a dad.   ""Unfortunately, I've got a baby coming,"" the winger said of his imminent departure. ""I'm lucky that the baby's due in December. Some guys, theyâ€™re leaving young kids and expecting mothers during the time we're away. But we're going out there and doing what we love. Everybody going in the bubble understands. You make sure your family is taken care of while youâ€™re away."" Hyman's wife, Alannah, will move in with his family during the playoffs, which gives the 28-year-old some peace of mind.   The stringent safety rules in Phase 4 mean teams will mostly be spending time amongst themselves, especially early on, and Hyman may end up picking the brain of some of the dads on the Leafs, including Tavares, Spezza, Clifford and  . Who's at the top of the list when it comes to asking for advice?  ""Come on, Spezz! He's got four of them so he knows what he's doing,"" Hyman said with a chuckle. ""I'm sure I'll be asking him for lots of advice.""  A detailed look at the NHL's safe zones and arenas for the Return to Play format. ðŸ‘€  MORE @    â€” BarDown (@BarDown)  --- Keefe has made it clear how valuable Toronto's one exhibition game will be in terms of both evaluating players and also how much progress the team has made when it comes to incorporating system tweaks, especially on the defensive side of things.  There are plenty of other questions that need to be answered as well.  ""One of them is the conditioning level of our group and seeing how we get through that in a game environment and playing three full periods, stop time,"" Keefe said. ""I've got to manage that ... I want to try to make sure I get them the appropriate minutes to prepare them for what's to come but, of course, not overdoing it and putting them in bad spots so thatâ€™s a challenge."" The Leafs held six scrimmages during Phase 3, but only once (Sunday July 19) did they play a full 60 minutes.   How intense will Tuesday's exhibition game against Montreal be?  ""You treat it like a real game, because that's the only way you can get prepared,"" said Hyman. ""I think all these exhibition games will be pretty intense and up tempo and I don't think anyone will be holding back.""  isn't as certain.   ""It will be competitive,"" the defenceman said. ""I'm not sure if guys will be really throwing the body. You don't want to lose a guy going into the meaningful games, but I'm sure it'll have a good pace to it. It'll be fast, if anything. I'm not sure if you'll see the typical dump and run guys over kind of thing that you might see in Game 1 of the play-in, but it will be good to get a game in and see what it's like with no fans and have the arena set-up, because it might be a bit odd.""  So, what exactly happened these last two weeks? Glad you asked.  Itâ€™s the return of   Training Camp Takeaways, presented for the first time ever in late July.  This is - dare I say - unprecedented:  â€” Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)  --- The exhibition game will be a key test for Toronto's power play, which struggled to convert down the stretch. Despite the four-month pause, assistant coach Paul McFarland hasn't made any big changes to the system or personnel.  ""The same idea,"" Barrie said of the unit's marching orders. ""We have the same crew."" How are things feeling so far?  ""You never get the full feel for it until you're in an actual game,"" Barrie said. ""We won't know until we get it going."" After the coaching change, Torontoâ€™s power play took off connecting on 27 of 86 chances (31.4 per cent) and leading the league from mid-November to early February. But from Feb. 8 to the end of the regular season, the Leafs connected on just six of 41 power-play chances (14.6 per cent), which ranked 26th in the NHL in that stretch.  ""When we were really going well it was just simple,"" said Barrie, who has retained his job as quarterback of the top unit. ""We were moving the puck quickly and shooting when we should and not over-complicating things. You can see [things work well] when we shoot and thereâ€™s a rebound and something special will happen off that either Mitch [Marner] finds someone backdoor or William [Nylander] or whoever would find the open guy. I think that's when we're at our best, when we're firing the puck and making plays off the rebounds and retrievals."" -- Forwards Nylander - Matthews - Hyman  Mikheyev - Tavares - Marner Robertson - Kerfoot - Kapanen  Clifford - Engvall / Spezza Gauthier  Defence Rielly - Ceci  Muzzin - Holl Dermott - Barrie  Sandin - Marincin  Goalies Andersen  Campbell PP1 Barrie  Marner - Tavares - Matthews  Nylander  PP2 Rielly  Kapanen - Kerfoot - Spezza Hyman            "

The   have loaned defenceman Mikko Lehtonen to Jokerit (KHL).  — Leafs PR (@LeafsPR)  Lehtonen signed a one-year, entry-level contract with the Leafs worth $925,000 back in May with the intent of making the jump to the NHL next season.  However, as Sportsnet’s Chris Johnston explains, Toronto is letting the Finnish defenceman return to his KHL club in order to play some games since the start of the 2020-21 NHL season will be delayed.  The   have lent defenceman Mikko Lehtonen back to KHL Jokerit. That'll give him a chance to play before the delayed start to the 2020-21 NHL season.  — Chris Johnston (@reporterchris)  With the AHL announcing that their season will start on Dec. 4, 2020, it would make sense for Lehtonen to start the season in the KHL which is currently in its pre-season schedule.  As Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman  , Leafs prospect Egor Korshkov was also planning to play in the KHL on a “loan” in order for him to have an opportunity to play.  Lehtonen averaged 22 minutes per night with Jokerit last season and had 49 points in 60 games — the sixth-highest total of any player in the KHL.

Image description text   TORONTO – To understand your own potential, it never hurts to measure yourself against greatness. The very best of   was broadcast loud on a Saturday night in mid-December when he helped silence   in prime time. The busiest three periods of Holl’s late-blooming NHL life concluded with a  Hockey Night in Canada  towel draped over his shoulders, a 4-1   win in the books and 2018-19’s most healthy-scratched player aw-shucks-ing his way through a conversation about limiting hockey’s most dangerous forward to one shot on net. Holl skated 26 minutes and 10 seconds in that victory. His Stanley Cup-winning shutdown partner,  , logged a season-high 27:01. McDavid, the Art Ross leader at the time, finished dash-2, pointless in 22:22 on home ice. Discussing Tuesday why he trusts Holl on his playoff shutdown pair, coach Sheldon Keefe referenced the “giant leap” the 28-year-old took on Dec. 14. “Justin Holl took a real large step for me when we were out in Edmonton and he had to play a lot against McDavid. That was a big a real big test and challenge,” Keefe said, “but he did very well with that. I think his confidence really took off from that point.” Since that win, Keefe noticed a consistency to Holl’s performance. Like any defenceman pulling on a blue-and-white sweater over the past half-century, Holl had some tough shifts against top lines. (When the Oilers came to Toronto on Jan. 6, McDavid put up four points and Holl took three minor penalties). But the difference between Holl’s worst efforts and his best wasn’t massive. In his first tour as an NHL regular, Holl posted a plus-13 rating — second to only Auston Matthews among Leafs with at least 60 games played — and earned a tidy three-year, $6-million contract extension through 2022-23 by running up against the elite. (Fun fact: Muzzin and Holl now rank one-two among Leafs defencemen in contract security.) “You can just see his confidence and feel for the game continue to grow,” John Tavares said. “He doesn’t get talked about much, but I think just as physicality, his mobility and then even the plays he’s making offensively, he’s just become such an all-around solid guy for us on the back end.” “He was just finding himself. Given his age and how long he’s been around and all those things, you lose sight of the fact that he’s still gaining experience,” Keefe added. “And as that sample grew, you just learn to trust him that much more.” The underlying numbers, and certainly a shared Calder Cup championship in 2018, support the coach’s trust. Despite being fed a steady diet of top-six forwards, the Muzzin-Holl pairing has produced the most positive scoring-chance and possession metrics of any Leafs blue line duo with a healthy sample size. When they’re on, 56 per cent of the shots are hitting the enemy’s net. And the 28 5-on-5 goals scored by the Leafs with Muzzin and Holl on the ice top all other Toronto pairs, per NaturalStatTrick.com. “Muzz is a great partner to play with — he makes my job easy. He’s really smart. He’s physical. He talks a lot. He’s really good at standing at the line and eliminating those zone entries,” Holl said. “I really can’t find a bad thing to say about him. He’s great offensively, too. So, I think all over the ice he’s a dependable partner. He’s got a lot of experience for me to lean on.” Muzzin and Holl have spent hours dissecting video together and discussing various plays and cycle-busting options. They are well aware that the Columbus Blue Jackets will try to impose a heavy game beneath the dots and that quick gap closes and rapid zone exits will be critical to winning the best-of-five set that begins Aug. 2. “They’re definitely aggressive on the forecheck and they are a lot to handle at times, so it’s going to be really important for us to break out clean and limit their opportunities to really get buzzin’ around the O-zone,” said Holl, who pinpoints winger Cam Atkinson as a threat. “They’re a team that doesn’t give up a whole lot defensively, which means that they kind of wait for you to make a mistake. So, we’re going to have to be prepared to take the counterpunch.” That preparation has been ongoing for months now. Muzzin, who blocked a shot and suffered a broken foot in late February, has been rehabbing and skating throughout the pandemic at Ford Performance Centre is ready to roll. Holl said goodbye to his wife in Minnesota the minute general manager Kyle Dubas called in June to tell him the Leafs’ practice facility had been approved as a quarantine facility. “I literally jumped in my car and just started driving,” Holl said of the 14-hour road trip.

You would too if you’d been waiting 28-and-a-half years for your first taste of do-or-die NHL action. “It’s going to be a big role, and I think we’re both super excited for it,” Holl said. “Everyone’s got a lot sharper — us included — and we’re just working our way toward being ready to play Game 1.” As he prepares to leave his family, Muzzin, the conscience of the pairing, reminds that “whoever wants it the most, executes the best, is going to come out on top.” If Muzzin and Holl can bottle the type of stifling performance they displayed on that frigid night in Alberta, they can be difference-makers. “Two big guys that have good sticks,” Keefe said. “It’s just been something that we found a good level of consistency with, and we don’t see a reason to mess with that.”                                     You can change your selections at any time.

While some of his teammates expressed trepidation at having to pack for Sunday's trip into the National Hockey League Phase 4 Secure Zone,   is unfazed. ""Yeah, I mean, you just got to pack your stuff and go in,"" the forward said nonchalantly. ""I don't think it's that big of a deal. Will be ready to go when the time comes."" The Leafs are hoping this will be a long trip lasting all the way into late September and possibly early October when the Stanley Cup is handed out in Edmonton. The first step is checking into Toronto's Royal York Hotel this weekend. ""Just bring the stuff that I would usually bring,"" Nylander said of his approach. ""Obviously a lot more stuff, but I think it will be pretty simple."" Often listed by teammates as one of the most fashionable Leafs, Nylander insists he hasn't given much thought to the lack of a dress code for games this summer.  ""I'm not too worried about that,"" he said. ""We're getting ready to play important games."" Nylander rarely gets rattled, which made last year's rough ride – seven goals in 54 games – following a prolonged contract stalemate so jarring. But the Swede bounced back in a big way during the 2019-20 regular season scoring 31 goals in 68 games. And, based on what we’ve seen so far at training camp, he's still feeling it. ""Willie is Willie,"" observed linemate  . ""It looks like he picked up where he left off when the season went on pause. He's skating well. He's got his long hair flowing in the wind when he's skating up and down the ice. He's playing with confidence and that's always a good sign when it comes to him.""  That   &   connection 👀   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Nylander, by the way, didn't get a haircut during the entire regular season or throughout the pandemic pause. It wasn't about superstition or style, for that matter. ""Lazy to go cut it,"" he explained with a grin. ​ ""He looks like a real Swede now,"" said good pal   a few days ago. Although Nylander did get a trim early in training camp.  ""I've cut it now for the remainder of the bubble time,"" the 24-year-old said. Nylander looks and sounds like a guy ready to roll. ""I feel pretty great,"" he said. ""We want to get back into playing real games, which will be soon. That will tell how the off-season has been going."" Sheldon Keefe has moved Nylander around at camp, playing him with centres   and  . He even had Nylander at centre on a line with Ilya Mikheyev and   in one scrimmage. The head coach hasn't noticed Nylander play much differently regardless of the spot. ""When Willie's at his best he's able to complement others but also help drive and make others better,"" Keefe noted. ""I like him in any of those situations and I'd say, similarly, even if he plays outside of those guys he's able to do things well. Will's capable of adapting and adjusting to his linemates, but also helping to make them better."" Nylander says his goal is to be ""dominant"" in the playoffs and prove himself on the big stage. Thursday’s scrimmage, which saw his line go up against the Tavares line, was another positive step forward. ""We were able to make it more game-like,"" Nylander noted. ""Obviously, it's hard when you're practising and scrimmaging to keep everything game-like, but today was pretty good. We had a tough start to the game, but we got going as the game went on. That's what we needed to have, because we'll be playing against the best guys on Columbus.""  From  : What a difference a year makes.    discusses how he wants to carry his regular season success this year into the play-in round after a forgettable 2018-19 campaign -    — TSN Hockey (@TSNHockey)  --- Thursday’s scrimmage consisted of two 20-minute, stop-time periods and started at 4 p.m., which is when Game 2 against the Jackets will be played. The players wore game sweaters and there was a full intermission and ice resurfacing after the first period as well as 'television timeout’ breaks in the regular spots. With Team Matthews clinching its scrimmage series against Team   on Wednesday, the groups were shuffled. For the first time, the two top lines went head-to-head with Mikheyev, Tavares and Mitch Marner getting the better of Nylander, Matthews and  . Mikheyev scored a hat trick and added two assists in the 6-3 win for Team Blue. ""He was excellent,"" said Keefe. ""He probably, more so than anybody, is really excited and happy to be back here playing in a team environment. It's been a long road for him to get back to playing in game action. He had a little extra jump all throughout this and that was really great to see. I thought today was his best day as well.""  Hats off to Souperman 🧢🧢🧢   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Mikheyev has been sidelined since a skate blade lacerated his right wrist on Dec. 27 leading to surgery to repair an artery and tendons. The assembled media at the Ford Performance Centre were asked to vote for the team's Phase 3 most valuable player and Mikheyev came out on top. It wasn't just a sentimental pick. ""He looks good,"" said Matthews. ""He looks really, really good. He's taken a lot of steps, obviously, with that pretty gruesome injury he had. He really worked hard to get back into game shape, skating all this time since the season went on pause so he's looked really good and I think he'll be a great asset for our team."" Mikheyev looked comfortable while playing alongside Tavares and Marner early in the season picking up 23 points in 39 games. After fellow left winger   joined Mikheyev on the long term injured list in February, the Leafs struggled to fill the void in the top six. Johnsson is still out after undergoing knee surgery in February so getting Mikheyev back and up to top-six speed is crucial. ""He and his line I thought were really good,"" said Keefe. ""They were playing with lots of pace and making lots of plays and seemed to have great chemistry throughout so that was a really good piece. It obviously means a lot to our team. It was a big hole in our lineup when he left. He and   both, at the same time, to leave the lineup were big holes and to have one of them back here is a great boost for us.""  *chef's kiss*   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  --- After spending the last couple practices and scrimmages on a line with Alex Kerfoot and Kapanen, Nick Robertson got a look on Toronto’s fourth unit in Thursday’s simulated game skating alongside   and  . “He's a focused individual,"" said Clifford. ""You can tell he wants to be here and be a part of what we're building and I really like his game. He has a really good shot and he's tenacious on the forecheck. There's no give-up in his game. It was fun to play with him today."" Keefe remains undecided about whether the 18-year-old will make his NHL debut in Game 1 against Columbus. ""The exhibition game will really help us refine things a little bit,"" Keefe said. ""I’ve really liked the progression that he’s shown. There are other things at play here, of course there’s his play, his development through all this and then there's also decisions to make on the other players who've played for us up until the pause. Then making a decision based on all those factors on what's going to help us best prepare to win Game 1.""  returned to his usual spot alongside Kerfoot and Kapanen in Thursday’s scrimmage, picking up a goal.   ended up on a Marlies line with   and  ​. The Leafs will play their lone exhibition game on Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens.  The possibility that Nick Robertson will make his   debut in the playoffs is getting more and more real with every passing day at Maple Leafs training camp.  More from  :    — TSN Hockey (@TSNHockey)  --- Keefe singled out Kapanen for making the most progress in the last few days of camp. ""Kappy would be the one who stood out to me in that area,"" Keefe said. ""If I look at his progression through the first three days of camp ... Kappy has really raised his level. The way that he's played the game in terms of using his speed, getting on the puck just having second and third efforts on the puck, those are the kind of things we need to see from him. He's a real difference maker for us when he does that and I've been happy to see that, it’s a real positive sign for us."" On Wednesday, Kapanen credited Clifford for inspiring him and bringing out the feisty side of his game, which is a key ingredient in his success. The pair formed a fast friendship since Clifford was acquired in a February trade with the Kings. ""He's a guy that probably doesn't get all the credit that he deserves just because of the amount of stars we have here,” Clifford said, ""but I think he's a tremendous player and when we have team success is when Kappy's at his best.""  🔥 'SMASH BROS' 💪  Kapanen on  : ""When you see a guy play hard & fight every now & then it fires me up for sure so it's been a positive impact for me""  Mitch Marner on Kasperi: ""He's got a fire under him"" — Mark Masters (@markhmasters)  --- TEAM BLUE   Mikheyev (3), Tavares, Marner (EN), Spezza (EN) Mikheyev - Tavares - Marner Clifford - Spezza - Robertson Petan - Gauthier - Korshkov Muzzin - Holl Sandin - Marincin Kivihalme - Hollowell Campbell TEAM WHITE   Matthews, Engvall, Malgin Nylander - Matthews -Nylander Engvall - Kerfoot - Kapanen Agostino - Brooks - Malgin Rielly - Ceci Dermott - Barrie Rosen - Gaudet Andersen           "

2020-08-02 14:38:43.825722,https://thehockeywriters.com/nhl-rumors-august-1-2020/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjDgf_y2oTrAhVKE4gKHZ3MDRM4FBDRjwUwCXoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw21-7aWcqyVl9LWWPUTaViX,"             In today’s NHL rumor rundown, the NHL has ruled on the conditions of three trades and there’s some debate about the merits of doing so. In Toronto, there is news the Maple Leafs are loaning out a prospect to the KHL. Finally, the New York Rangers started a surprising goalie against the Hurricanes. Why not go with the best netminder? Teams involved in trades that had conditions or conditional draft picks attached no longer have to wait to find out what will happen with those conditions. The NHL has ruled on trades involving the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and other teams.  In the trade that saw James Neal come to Edmonton for Milan Lucic (to Calgary),   that Edmonton will have to transfer a third-round pick in either 2020 or 202 to complete the trade.  The Oilers will have until the start of the third round in October’s draft to decide if the selection will come this year or next. James Neal, Edmonton Oilers ( /The Hockey Writers) There is a lot of debate about whether or not this was a fair decision. The condition of the trade was that Neal had to have at least 21 goals and Lucic ten or fewer.  Neal scored 19 when the season was shut down and Lucic was at eight, meaning only the Lucic portion of the condition was met. It appears the league prorated Neal’s goal pace over 82 games.  The Oilers are now without their second-round pick for the next two years and a fourth-rounder in 2020, along with this third-rounder.  Condition of Maple Leafs and Kings Trade The NHL has ruled on terms of the Los Angeles Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs trade that saw Jack Campbell and Kyle Clifford go to Toronto. Toronto will owe a 2021 second-round pick if they win their Qualifying Round series against Columbus and Campbell gets two or more wins  or  if Clifford re-signs. Hurricanes and Devils Trade Condition Ruling With the Carolina Hurricanes’ acquisition of Sami Vatanen, Sportsnet’s   that if Carolina beats New York in the Qualifying Round series and Vatanen plays in 70% or more of their playoff games, the Hurricanes send New Jersey their 2020 third-round pick.  He also writes: If he plays in less than 70 per cent of CAR’s playoff games, then it depends on if Vatanen appears twice against NYR. If yes and CAR wins the series, NJ gets a CAR 4th this year. If yes and NYR wins, Hurricanes get the choice of a 4th this year or next….  If he doesn’t play twice against NYR, there’s no pick going to NJ. Easy! The   that they have loaned Mikko Lehtonen to the KHL. The blueliner will head back to Jokerit to start next season and is expected to report to the team next week. The   have loaned defenceman Mikko Lehtonen to Jokerit (KHL). — Leafs PR (@LeafsPR)  Lehtonen will be the second Toronto player loaned out to the KHL to start next season as it was reported Egor Korshkov would be loaned to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. The idea is to get some playing time in before training camps start up again. Henrik Lundqvist started in net for the New York Rangers versus the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. Igor Shesterkin was not on the ice and reports were that he was deemed “unfit to play” today.  Igor Shesterkin, New York Rangers (Photo by Glenn James/NHLI via Getty Images) The NBC broadcast showed him inside the building watching the game, which means his absence is not related to COVID-19. If he tested positive, he would already be isolated, according to protocol. According  , Tuukka Rask “wasn’t feeling well” and missed practice, according to Bruce Cassidy. Unclear if he’ll be able to start tomorrow’s game against Philadelphia.
