Toronto Maple Leafs stars  ,   and   all stated a case for patience over significant changes on Wednesday after the team failed to reach the playoff field this season. ""We have tremendous youth. The harder thing to do is staying the course of the group and for us...asking a lot of tough questions and challenging one another to be better,"" Tavares said during an end-of-season media call. ""As a core, we believe in what we have and how we play. It's just a matter of doing it more consistently and [playing] harder,"" defenceman   added. ""This core believes we're right there,"" centre   said. ""We don't really care what other people think, or how far away other people think we are... we're going to power through this adversity and we'll break through eventually.""   on confidence in   core: ""I think we have a lot of guys who want to win. And that's the belief I have. The wanting to win is crucial to drive players, and I believe it's in there. I believe this group is capable of winning it all."" — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)  The Maple Leafs lost Game 5 to the Columbus Blue Jackets in their play-in series on Sunday to miss out on the playoffs. Toronto has not won a playoff series since 2004 and exited in the first round of postseason in each of the previous three years. ""We're disappointed, and it sucks to be in the spot we're in,"" Tavares said. ""That just has to continue to fuel the fire. The consistency has to be a lot better... but when you go through a lot of tough moments, you have to embrace [those] obstacles."" Bryan Hayes, Jamie McLennan and Jeff O’Neill are joined by TSN Director of Scouting Craig Button to debate if it’s time for the Leafs to have a change in their philosophy and if president Brendan Shanahan might want to make the Leafs more similar to the teams he played and won Cups with. ""Doubt creeps in when you're down in a series, and it's about being mentally strong, keeping that edge and really being able to push through,"" said Reilly. ""So I think that's an area that we have to work on.""  ""A lot of it is mindset,"" noted  . ""We have to figure out playoffs, and how to get out of the first round. I think four years [of losing], obviously it's pretty frustrating and a little bit embarrassing as well."" ""I'm frustrated and everybody's frustrated, our team's frustrated, we're not happy with results,"" said forward  . ""We're building towards being in a position where it's going to stop sucking."" ""It's been one game that's the reason we're going home early,"" winger Mitch Marner said. ""I don't know how to explain it. I don't know why we can't get the job done. It's frustrating. [But] it's going to be really fun to have Sheldon as a full coach this year.""  Mitch Marner on his series vs.  : ""The first game, I wasn't engaged at all, in the physicalness of play at all. And then from that point on, I felt like I got a lot more engaged and playing as my old self...but zero goals isn't going to get the job done."" — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)  Named captain of the Maple Leafs prior to this season, Tavares took accountability for his role in the team's failings. ""It starts with me and the example I set ... I have to be better,"" the 29-year-old said. Tavares, who signed a seven-year, $77 million with the Maple Leafs in 2018, had two goals and three points in five games against the Blue Jackets. He had 26 goals and 60 points in 63 games during the regular season. The Maple Leafs have just $4.59 million in projected cap space for next season with 17 players under contract.  Defencemen     along with forwards   and   are slated for unrestricted free agency. Barrie said Wednesday he has ""no idea what the future holds.""  ""A bit of a disappointing year all around,"" Barrie told reporters. ""I would have loved to have helped this team more. We've got a great group of guys here and I'm really pulling for them going forward."" ""I know that I'm not the player I once was, but I do feel like I can help quite a bit, and the fire still burns and I really hope to be back here next year,"" said Spezza. ""It's special to play for the Toronto Maple Leafs,"" Spezza continued. ""As a Toronto boy, it's something I dreamed of. You wanted to be a part of something special. I didn't take for granted any day with a jersey on and it's really disappointing to be done this early.""   on why he left Game 5: ""I banged my head on the ice pretty hard. Had some headaches and they're pretty careful with the concussion stuff. I'm feeling pretty good right now."" — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)  Goaltender  , who is under contract through next season at a cap hit of $5 million, said he's not focused n his future. ""Whatever's going to happen, will happen,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I can only focus on what I can control.""   on   series: ""I felt the most comfortable I've felt in a playoff series. We didn't get the job done, which is frustrating. If we keep learning and keep building, eventually it's going to click and we're going to be really dangerous."" — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)              ",2020-08-12 10:53:04.132615

Image description text   TORONTO — Uncle. Enough. It’s time. The   need defencemen. Plural.  And, God bless Rasmus Sandin and Timothy Liljegren, but they need some defencemen who are proven. Yes, that means they might cost more than $700,000. Yes, that means subtracting some cap-allotted dollars from the most expensive forward brigade in the sport. Do you know what the NHL’s top nine defensive teams (by goals allowed per game) in 2019-20 all have in common? They’re all alive and well in the playoffs. The real ones that start Tuesday. That group includes the Columbus Blue Jackets. Do you know what the bottom 10 defensive teams in 2019-20 all have in common? They’re all eliminated. That group includes the Maple Leafs, who lost Sunday’s decisive Game 5 by a score of 3-0.  They were also up 3-0 in a pivotal Game 3 and could not lock it down. We’ve beat this drum before, like on the night Mitch Marner   to give Kyle Dubas’s lottery-bound squad the top three highest-salaried forwards in hockey. But circumstances have changed. First and foremost, Dubas’s hefty financial commitments to John Tavares, Auston Matthews, William Nylander and Marner were all made on the (very reasonable) assumption that the salary cap would not only continue to rise with each passing Canada Day but that it could take a dramatic spike when the next U.S. broadcast deal kicked in. That, of course, is no longer the case. The cap will remain flat until the virus decides otherwise. Second, instead of taking a step forward, the Leafs — as a whole — have stumbled back. More than half the NHL is still bubbled up and battling for the Stanley Cup. They are not. The Nazem Kadri trade, though explainable at the time, was a whiff. When push came to shove, rookie coach Sheldon Keefe took Tyson Barrie off the No. 1 power-play unit and replaced him with Morgan Rielly. Alexander Kerfoot’s third line wasn’t awful, but he and Kasperi Kapanen were both handed nice raises last summer. Neither scored a playoff goal, despite Keefe’s proclamation that he expected production throughout the lineup. During the regular season, Toronto has been one of the most dangerous clubs at even strength that money can buy. The post-season is a different beast. One that has gnawed on this core for four years in a row, no matter who’s behind the bench or how much ice time the stars are handed.  Cap hit of Leafs top line today: $33.53M  Cap hit of all 11 forwards the Blue Jackets dressed today: $34.33 M  — Dimitri Filipovic (@DimFilipovic)  As the buzzer sounded in their hollow home Sunday night and Toronto joined the budget-conscious, punchline Florida Panthers as the only two franchises of the salary-cap era yet to survive a single playoff series, a few snapshots spoke volumes: • A white-knuckle sequence in the D-zone where both Tavares and Matthews were scrambling around without sticks in their hands, trying to get into shot lanes. • Matthews, Marner and Tavares bent over their sticks, gasping for breath after playing 21-plus minutes apiece and still failing to score a  fourth  even-strength goal for Toronto over five games. • A dour Matthews — arguably the series MVP in a losing cause — bluntly saying he didn’t have an answer for the trend he saw in the core’s 0-for-4 performance in elimination series. • And Keefe praising the Blue Jackets’ forwards for being so good. The coach also brought up luck, which is seldom a good look.  “A little more luck, and it might be a different result,” Keefe said, noting his team scored on fewer than two per cent of its shots 5-on-5.  Auston Matthews was the only plus player (+1) for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the series.  — luke fox (@lukefoxjukebox)  Because Dubas built his roster as the counter argument to “defence wins championships,” Keefe spent three months of quarantine and the entirety of reset camp tweaking his system and urging his players to buy into improved own-zone play by all five guys. For the most part, it worked. The Leafs did a decent job keeping Columbus out of the danger areas and shut the Jackets out in Game 2. Yet it came at the expense of their identity, their strength. The roster isn’t balanced, so it has fallen to two coaches and some ill-equipped personnel to mask that imbalance. “I’ll be thinking about this one for a while,” a sombre Keefe said post-game. The Leafs will pack their Louis bags and carry a 5-on-5 goal drought of 182:46 worth of game clock into 2020-21. With no Plan B when the sticks go cold, a desperate Keefe tried to make William Nylander a centre. He bumped one of the game’s best forecheckers, Zach Hyman, to Line 2, and stacked his top line. He threw surprise Andreas Johnsson into the mix, even though the winger hadn’t played since before Valentine’s Day. The coach second-guessed his own decisions and deviated from the centre depth that was supposed to attack in unrelenting waves. That’s what solid, committed defences do to their opponents. They frustrate them. Make ’em blink. “We can’t lose sight of who we are as a team,” Keefe said prior to Game 1, prophetically. “We need to be really good offensively.” Conversely, John Tortorella’s group rolled out a trusted game plan night after night.  No secrets to the recipe: Hard work. Heart. Two good goalies. And plenty of quality defencemen who couldn’t care less about their point totals. “We’re not changing,” Tortorella said of Game 4’s epic collapse. “We pissed it away on a couple of bad plays and just within a couple of minutes, [but] we thought we played a good game. We’re going to go play the same way.” “May the best team win,” Jackets captain Nick Foligno wished pre-game. It did. Not only did Toronto’s regular-season deficiencies on the blueline have Keefe and the Leafs second-guessing their own game plan, but the loss of Jake Muzzin — the club’s best pure defender — for Games 3, 4 and 5 underscored an organizational crisis. If you truly have Stanley Cup expectations, one injured defenceman should not be a critical blow against a middle-of-the-pack opponent. For 2020-21, Dubas has already committed $52 million to NHL forwards. On defence? Just $15 million. That gap has to close. The books need a little balance. The Maple Leafs’ blue line is crying for more depth. It’s time. Enough. Uncle.                                     You can change your selections at any time.

(Andre Ringuette/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images) The Maple Leafs fired blanks when it mattered most — and ran out of miracles. Now Toronto's talented, high-powered roster has a long time to contemplate what might have been. Joonas Korpisalo made 33 saves as the Columbus Blue Jackets shut out the Leafs 3-0 on Sunday to win their best-of-five qualifying round series 3-2. Toronto staged a stunning comeback down 3-0 with under four minutes to go in Friday's Game 4 to stave off elimination before winning in overtime to force the decider, but were unable to figure out a way through a stingy, defensive-minded opponent. ""We knew it would be a challenge,"" Leafs captain John Tavares said. ""We have to find a way to break through."" Unfortunately for Toronto, that didn't happen for a group that sat second in the NHL with 237 goals when the season was suspended in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Leafs were outscored 10-3 at 5-on-5, and weren't able to get anything going at even strength after rookie Nick Robertson scored midway through Game 3. ""We knew when they get their leads they just locked down the neutral zone,"" Toronto winger Mitch Marner said. ""We had some chances. They just didn't go in."" Columbus, the No. 9 seed in the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL's 24-team restart to its pandemic-hit campaign, will now face the Tampa Bay Lightning in the usual 16-slot playoff bracket. ""We don't do it the easy way... I'm proud of them,"" Blue Jackets head coach John Tortorella said. ""I thought [Korpisalo] was outstanding, made key saves at key times. ""It's a good group of men trying to find their way."" Zach Werenski, rookie Liam Foudy, with his first NHL goal, and Nick Foligno, into an empty net, scored for the Blue Jackets, who lost Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Sergei Bobrovsky in free agency last summer, but still found a way to advance. Frederik Andersen stopped 19 shots for Toronto, which hasn't won a post-season series since 2004. ""Columbus defended extremely well and didn't give us a great deal, but we had enough chances to score more goals in the two shutouts,"" said Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe, alluding to his team's 2-0 loss in Game 1. ""[If] we had more luck, it might have been a different result. I'm not sure where it's gonna finish up, but we ended up shooting at about two per cent on 5-on-5. For a team like ours to score on two per cent of its chances, I think anybody coming into the series would say it's pretty unlikely. ""That's the way it went."" Korpisalo started the first three games, including that shutout in the opener, before getting pulled with his team trailing 3-0 in Game 3, but got the call with Elvis Merzlikins unfit to play. ""We were all nervous as the season started with the departures,"" Tortorella added. ""We were nervous with what are goaltending was going to be. We don't have a sniff being here if it's not for those two guys."" In the climax of series accented by dramatic momentum swings — Toronto fell 4-3 in overtime in Game 3 after blowing a three-goal lead before staging that stunning comeback the following night — Columbus opened the scoring at 6:29 of the first period. After leaving Friday's Game 4, Werenski floated a shot from the point that hit Leafs defenceman Tyson Barrie in front and sailed past a surprised Andersen inside an empty Scotiabank Arena. Keefe loaded up his top line with Tavares, Marner and Auston Matthews, and the trio was buzzing in the offensive zone most of the first two periods. Tavares had his team's best chance of the opening 20 minutes, but his rushed shot at a wide-open net hit the post and stayed out. ""My hand slipped just a tad,"" Tavares said. ""Unfortunately, it was maybe half an inch quarter of an inch too much to the right."" Leafs winger Ilya Mikheyev grazed the crossbar with a shot earlier in the period, while Blue Jackets forward Alexandre Texier rattled Andersen's mask at the other end. The Toronto netminder had to be sharp early the second after Justin Holl turned the puck over. Foudy had one shot before Oliver Bjorkstrand followed up with two more. Tavares and Matthews then came close on Korpisalo, while Foligno forced a good pad stop out of Andersen. Already without Jake Muzzin after he was stretchered off late in Game 2, the Leafs went down to five defenceman not long after when Boone Jenner rocked Barrie in the corner. The Toronto blue-liner stayed down for time, went straight to the locker room and did not return. The Leafs got their first power play when Werenski crosschecked Tavares, but both Toronto's captain and Matthews couldn't find a way through Korpisalo on good chances. The Leafs are left to pick up the pieces following another post-season disappointment that comes on the heels of consecutive Game 7 playoff losses to the Boston Bruins.       (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press ) William Nylander forced a good save out of Korpisalo early in the third after the Leafs killed a Columbus power play. Toronto continued to push, but Foudy made it 2-0 at 11:20 when he snuck a shot under Andersen on a play that materialized out of nothing. ""Amazing,"" said Foudy, a Toronto native. ""Growing up being a huge Leafs fan, always going for them, to come here play in a series and beat them and score my first NHL goal is something I won't forget. A special moment."" Andreas Johnsson, who underwent knee surgery in February and was a surprise addition to the Toronto setup after being activated off injured reserve, was robbed by Korpisalo moments later on a terrific opportunity. Unlike Friday's chaotic finish, the Blue Jackets killed the game off from there, with Foligno icing it into an empty net, and will now play Tampa — the Presidents' Trophy-winning team they upset in last season's first round with a four-game sweep — in the normal playoff format. The Leafs, meanwhile, are left to pick up the pieces following another post-season disappointment that comes on the heels of consecutive Game 7 playoff losses to the Boston Bruins. ""A tough pill to swallow,"" Matthews said. ""It's very disappointing."" Fans in both NHL hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, saw their teams eliminated in the qualifying round of the restart. The Oilers lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in four games.  Andersen dropped to 0-8 with an .877 save percentage and 3.49 goals against average in his last eight potetial series-clinching appearance. Toronto will be part of the second phase of the draft lottery Monday with the seven other losers from the qualifying round. Each club has a 12.5 per cent chance of securing the No. 1 pick. Muzzin watched the game from the stands. Johnsson took the place of rookie Nick Robertson. Blue Jackets defenceman Ryan Murray returned to the lineup after missing Game 4. Add some “good” to your morning and evening. A variety of newsletters you'll love, delivered straight to you.

They remain the only NHL franchise who hasn’t won a playoff series in the salary cap era. This season, the Leafs didn’t even make the Stanley Cup Playoffs, as they lost in the play-in round to the Columbus Blue Jackets. It’s clear that changes need to be made in Toronto. Their current way of doing things is simply not working. They’re committing over $40 million to four forwards and that’s simply not sustainable given their roster’s needs. Expect the Leafs to be quite active this offseason. Last summer, they traded   for   and  . That clearly wasn’t enough. The Leafs have a lot of work to do if they want to become Stanley Cup contenders. Here are three players they should trade as they try to retool their talented roster. 1. Andreas Johnsson More from  Puck Prose The Leafs signed Kerfoot,  , and   to virtually identical deals last summer. Johnsson got a four-year deal worth $3.4 million annually. Kapanen is the most useful member of the trio, so it makes sense to keep him. Kerfoot is a useful defensive center who can produce at a respectable rate, so trading him makes little sense. That leaves Johnsson, who’s a bit expendable. Toronto Maple Leafs Carlton Bear Bobblehead A huge reason he’s expendable is because of Nicholas Robertson, who proved he’s ready for a spot on the NHL roster after an impressive showing against the Blue Jackets. He can do what Johnsson can do (and likely more) at a much cheaper price. Packaging him with a draft pick for a top-four defenseman makes a lot of sense. Personally, I think the Leafs should target New Jersey Devils defenseman  . The Devils could use someone like Johnsson and I don’t think the Leafs would need to add much to the deal to make it work.      Newsletter   Your Puck Prose.  Your Inbox. Every Day.

Tortorella, the Blue Jackets coach, responded to criticism leveled at Keefe, the Maple Leafs coach, for decisions made during the best-of-5 series, won by Columbus with a 3-0 victory in Game 5 at Scotiabank Arena on Sunday. The Blue Jackets advanced to play the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference First Round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Game 1 is in Toronto, the hub city for the East, on Tuesday (3 p.m. ET; NBCSN, SN, TVAS). The Maple Leafs have not won a postseason series since a seven-game victory against the Ottawa Senators in the 2004 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. ""I just can't get over people ripping Sheldon Keefe and his staff as far as the job he's done with the Maple Leaf team,"" Tortorella said. ""They have done a terrific job with that team. Now this is after the series and all that, and some of the things I read, some of the things I watched last night, I mean, half the pundits in this city think they really know about the game, but they really don't. And it just [upsets me] for a fellow coach in this league."" Keefe played most of his 125 NHL games for the Lightning from 2000-03 with Tortorella as his coach. He was hired by Toronto to replace Mike Babcock on Nov. 20 following a 9-10-4 start and was 27-15-5 in 47 games. He coached Toronto of the American Hockey League to the Calder Cup in 2018. ""And I know it's Toronto, a great city, a great hockey town, I love being here,"" Tortorella said. ""But some of the things he's criticized for are beyond belief to me. And it just shows that people have no clue what's going on in this game. So I just want to support him, I'm glad we won, but I just want to support him, and his staff have done a terrific job with that hockey club."" The Maple Leafs (36-25-9, .579 points percentage) were the No. 8 seed in the East. They were one of eight teams (Edmonton Oilers, Florida Panthers, Minnesota Wild, Nashville Predators, New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Winnipeg Jets) eliminated from the Qualifiers that had a 12.5 percent chance at the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NHL Draft, won by the Rangers, in the Second Phase of the NHL Draft Lottery on Monday. Alexis Lafreniere, a left wing for Rimouski of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, is the projected top pick.   Share this!!

Asking veteran Zach Hyman to give his No. 11 to Alexis Lafreniere if Toronto wins Monday night’s NHL draft lottery, to make the Rimouski junior star feel right at home.   The sting of defeat would certainly be forgotten if the Leafs logo is the last one revealed on the live telecast, which starts at 6 p.m. Eastern time, locally on Sportsnet. Toronto and seven other qualifying losers in their best-of-five series each have a 12.5% chance of getting top pick, with the 6-foot-1 Lafreniere pulling away with the lead ranking by Central Scouting. The left winger had 35 goals and 77 assists for the Oceanic, was MVP at the world junior championship before capturing the Jean Beliveau Trophy as leading scorer in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, as well as its ‘personality of the year’ and Canadian Hockey League player of the year. “His hockey IQ is at the highest level possible,” Jean-Francois Damphousse, of Central Scouting, told   earlier this year. “He’s not a finesse guy who only relies on his overall skills — he competes, he hits, he finishes checks, and is really entertaining to watch. You can feel it when he’s on the ice. “I wasn’t there when Sidney Crosby played (for Rimouski from 2003-05), but you got that feeling that something special was going to happen every time he was on the ice. Alexis brings that same level of excitement.” Toronto, which selected Auston Matthews first overall in 2016 based on its lottery win after a last-place finish, did not expect to be in this consolation conversation for years to come. But first came the the COVID-19 pandemic that halted the season and derailed the entire June draft plan. In the first of two phases of the lottery, in which the eight qualifying also-rans were included, a place-holding team wound up chosen ahead of the seven that missed the playoffs, with just a 2.5% chance going in. So despite some big names already on their roster, Toronto, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Pittsburgh, the Rangers, Florida, Minnesota and Nashville are in the Lafreniere sweepstakes. Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas will not comment until after the draft and it was too soon for coach Sheldon Keefe on Sunday night to consider the upside of getting a Lafreniere ticket after absorbing the 3-0 loss in Game 5. “I’m not focused on it one bit, but it is the next thing on the calendar for us,” Keefe said. “I’ll be paying attention to it, but thinking about this (defeat) for quite a while.” Toronto traded its 2020 first-round pick and Patrick Marleau to Carolina, but it’s top-10 protected. If the Leafs don’t win the lottery tonight, their pick will revert to the Hurricanes and will be either 13th or 14th. But if the Leafs do win the lottery, the pick becomes an unprotected first-rounder going to Carolina in 2021. This year, the Hurricanes acquired defenceman Brady Skjei from the New York Rangers for a first-round pick — the Rangers will get whichever of the picks is worse, which would be Carolina’s own pick. The lottery winner will become just the 10th team since the draft was created in 1963 to have made a post-season appearance and also get No. 1. The Los Angeles Kings won a separate draw to choose second, Ottawa third, while Detroit, who had the best odds, dropped to fourth. After No. 1 and the other non-playoff teams, the seven remaining qualifying series losers will be positioned nine to 15 in inverse order of their points percentage. Selections 16 to 31 depend on results of the current playoffs. The revamped draft, with no host city because of COVID, is scheduled for Oct. 9-10, a few days after the Stanley Cup final is due to wrap up in Edmonton.

I mean, what in the world could the Maple Leafs need from Nazem Kadri with the talent they have in their lineup already? But it goes far deeper than what he showed on the score sheet and is more of what the Maple Leafs missed in their play-in series with the Columbus Blue Jackets is that little bit of edge. And that’s exactly what Kadri brought to the lineup. While Leafs Nation somewhat celebrated   and his contract to the Colorado Avalanche on July 1, 2019, in exchange for Tyson Barrie and Alex Kerfoot, looking back it raises the question of whether or not the Maple Leafs moved their heart and soul player that day. What hurts the discussion of Kadri’s importance to the team is his history of questionable hits come playoff time. In fact, each of the past two years, Kadri earned suspensions that cost him the rest of the Maple Leafs’ first round series against the Boston Bruins both in 2017-18 and 2018-19. Not only did he miss the remainder of each series, but it left the Maple Leafs without one of the players that brought a physical edge to their game and got under the skin of his opponents. See, like a handful of other players around the league, Kadri plays on the edge. His game straddles the line of what is deemed acceptable and not in the game of hockey, but it makes him a successful player at both ends of the ice. Nazem Kadri was forced to answer a lot of questions in Toronto following some of his questionable hits. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov) Even if it did leave the Maple Leafs shorthanded on a number of occasions, the way he played the game and played hard on each and every play is somewhat irreplaceable without the right pieces in the lineup. While he’s remembered for his hits on Bruins’ Jake DeBrusk and Tommy Wingels in consecutive first-round playoff series, what people forget is that Kadri is a two-time 30-goal scorer who also stopped Connor McDavid to ultimately win the game for the Maple Leafs once upon a time. He’s a two-way player that developed into a legitimate NHL centre. But his   played against him. His salary and questionable plays forced the Maple Leafs to make a decision and ended up leading to the end of his Maple Leafs’ career. Playing on the edge or not, there’s no question that Kadri played with fire, physicality and for the teammates that skated with him. After all, his last suspension in a Maple Leafs’ uniform was in response to a questionable hit on veteran teammate Patrick Marleau. As a teammate though he was more valuable than many gave him credit for – especially against teams like the Bruins and, this year’s opponent, the Columbus Blue Jackets who both play a similar physical game. While the Maple Leafs are a team littered with talent, they sometimes lack in getting under the skin of their opponents and channeling their physical side of the game. Enter Kadri – who over 19 playoff games with the team spanning four seasons averaged almost three hits per game. But it was the intangibles like aggravating the Brad Marchands and Jake DeBrusks of the game that made him so irreplaceable. Kadri always had a way of getting under the skin of his opponents. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Mary Schwalm) Sure, the Maple Leafs added Kyle Clifford to their lineup, but his game differs from Kadri’s in that he isn’t so much of a pest as he is a grinder. Both types of players are needed. Both are valuable in their own way. Regardless, the Maple Leafs are still lacking that get-under-your-skin type of player. The one that can drive opponents nuts and still be a valuable offensive and defensive commodity. Marchand is that type of player for the Bruins. Kadri used to be that type of player for the Maple Leafs. Even now, look what he’s been able to add to the Avalanche during their round robin play. In nearly 20 minutes of ice-time per game, Kadri has four points in three games, including a literal buzzer beater that got his team a win. Three of his points have come on the power play as he’s an asset in front of the net and he has thrown four hits with no penalty minutes over that span. Can a player change? Without a doubt. But even as a player who might’ve taken a step back from that line he teetered on so often, Kadri has been a valuable addition to the Avalanche and a major missing piece for the Maple Leafs on their playoff journey. Either way, the team remains without the right pieces to get over the hump come playoff time with their series against the Blue Jackets just another example of that. A defeat that leaves more questions for Leafs Nation, than answers.   start:tags     end:tags    start:article footer     end:article footer         Ezoic - BottomNative - native_bottom    placeholder 111 blocked.

SPORTSCENTRE Reporter   TSN Toronto reporter Mark Masters checks in daily with news and notes on the Maple Leafs, who practised at Ford Performance Centre on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's Game 3 against the Columbus Blue Jackets. What did Sheldon Keefe learn about   when the 23-year-old was promoted to Toronto's top defence pair in six games right before the season pause? ""Just that he can handle it when called upon,"" the Leafs coach said. With   sidelined for the rest of the qualifying-round series against Columbus, Dermott is being asked to step up again. Coming off shoulder surgery, Dermott started slow in the regular season, but played some of his best hockey in late February and early March after Muzzin broke his finger during a game in Tampa. With   and   also sidelined, Dermott joined good pal and former Marlies teammate   in tangling with top lines.  ""Both guys were taking on greater responsibility,"" recalled Keefe. ""Holl had really been doing it most of the season, taking a big step in terms of his responsibility and his role. Dermott's evolving and taking on more as it comes. It's really been injury situations that's given him more opportunity throughout the entire season and this is no different."" Per the website NaturalStatTrick, Dermott and Holl played together for 297 minutes and 40 seconds at five-on-five in the regular season, making them Toronto's fifth-most common pair. The opposition outscored the Leafs 12-11 in those minutes, but the underlying numbers were positive with the Leafs controlling 50.28 per cent of the shot attempts and 53.46 per cent of the expected goals. At Wednesday’s practice, Dermott once again took Muzzin's spot alongside Holl. ""Every single player is valuable and Muzz certainly is one of the most valuable and important people, but I also believe in our game in particular that everyone is replaceable,"" said Keefe. “We're going to have guys come in and step up and continue rolling as a team."" The Leafs went 7-5-4 with Muzzin out of the lineup during the regular season.   If the Maple Leafs are going to get past Columbus in the play-in series, it will have to be without one of their top defenceman in Jake Muzzin. While Travis Dermott will move up to slot in next to Justin Holl, head coach Sheldon Keefe explains why Martin Marincin is ahead of Rasmus Sandin on the depth chart for the last spot.   --- On Tuesday night,   described Muzzin's contribution to the Leafs as ""unmeasurable."" You can certainly understand why. Muzzin is a big leader off the ice as one of only two Stanley Cup champions on the roster. He consistently logs tough minutes against top lines while also playing on the penalty kill. Muzzin led the team in hits and is the club's most physical presence on the back end. Earlier this season, Keefe referred to Muzzin as the ""conscience"" of the team. ""I don't think you can replace what he does for our team, but I think it's important to have other guys help fill that void,” said defenceman  . ""He really offers a lot, but it's a good opportunity for guys to play more minutes and in different situations and rise to the occasion."" That includes Rielly, who rose to the occasion in Game 2 after he and Ceci got off to a shaky start in the series. ""They moved the puck a lot more efficiently,"" Keefe observed of the pair. ""Morgan, in particular, was really sharp. I think he made some adjustments from Game 1 to Game 2 that really helped that pairing a lot and helped our team as a result. I thought we played a really good team game that really helped everybody."" Rielly played a team-high 24 minutes and 37 seconds on Tuesday and sealed the win with an empty-net goal.   With Jake Muzzin out for the rest of the series against Columbus, the Maple Leafs' defensive depth will be put to the test. TSN Hockey analyst Mike Johnson joins Gino Reda to assess the impact Muzzin's absence will have on Toronto's blueline. --- With Muzzin out,   will draw into the lineup on Thursday. It will be Marinicn's first Stanley Cup playoff game since the 2017 series against the Washington Capitals. The Slovak skated with   on the third pair at Wednesday's practice. ""We think that Marty brings some of the elements that Muzz brings,” Keefe explained. ""In particular, the penalty kill, the size and all those types of things, there are some similarities there in terms of what he can provide us and we think that's important."" The 6-foot-5 Marincin, who won a Calder Cup while playing for Keefe with the Marlies in 2018, suited up in 26 games for the Leafs in the regular season averaging 1:40 of shorthanded ice time per game. ​ Keefe revealed he's considering dressing seven defencemen on Thursday, which means rookie   may make his NHL playoff debut.  The betting here is the Leafs will dress seven defencemen for Game 3 against Columbus. They will use   in some situations, especially PK. And they'll use use   in offensive situations. Don't know which forward will come out of the lineup. — steve simmons (@simmonssteve)  --- Mostly quiet in Game 1, Tavares exploded for eight shots on Tuesday night, including a breakaway goal. How did the Leafs and their captain finally get some rush chances against the stingy Jackets? ""We were just quicker and that's not just necessarily the way we're moving our feet, but I think just our execution and the way we moved the puck,"" Tavares explained in his post game Zoom session. ""I thought the D did a great job of just handling their forecheck, which they [Jackets] do really well, and then I think as forwards we were just in sync reading off each other and doing [a] good job of, when we had to, getting pucks in behind and getting on the inside and first on those races that allowed us to then set up the next couple of plays to break them down and create some opportunities, some more possessions. It's something we have to continue, especially when you expect them to make some adjustments.”  The Captain!   puts the Leafs up by two  — Omar (@TicTacTOmar)  In Game 2, the Leafs didn't just have the skill edge, they seemed to be outworking the Jackets all over the ice. ""I don't think it’s rocket science how we need to play in order to have success,"" said Columbus winger  . ""I think we saw that last game with just our effort and our energy level, it wasn't where it needed to be and it's the reason why we didn't have the result that we wanted. We shore that up and I think we have a better result."" Foligno wants the Jackets to play more physical in Game 3 and fire more shots toward Toronto’s net even from bad angles in an attempt to break them down. Columbus only had 12 shots on net through two periods in Game 2. ""Our forecheck needs to be better,"" the Jackets captain said. ""I mean, it’s all stuff that we know. That's why I think we're moving past it. If there's one thing about our team, we always seem to bounce back the right way and that's why I'm confident in this group and what we're going to bring tomorrow and knowing that this is a really important game for us.""   The TSN Hockey panel praises the Leafs' ""perfect response"" in their bounce back effort in Game 2, explains how Sheldon Keefe's lineup tweaks paid dividends, and credits the timeliness of some of Frederik Andersen's saves in an impressive performance.  --- In the minutes after his team's shutout loss on Tuesday night, John Tortorella was in no mood to offer reporters an autopsy. ""Toronto played a really good game,” the Jackets coach said. ""We sucked."" Tortorella repeated that comment a couple times in his Zoom session. The veteran bench boss remained tightlipped on Wednesday when asked how the Jackets can create more possession in the Leafs end. ""We're just going to play,"" he said. ""Get prepared to play the right way and go about our business."" A follow-up question led to a listing of the team itinerary. ""You guys are killing me,"" Tortorella said. ""Listen, we're going to prepare to play the game ... We had a meeting today at 11:30 a.m. with coaches. We had a 2:30 practice, we'll have an 11 o'clock meeting tomorrow and then we'll play at 8 o'clock. I'm not going to talk about what adjustments we have to make, what we have to do differently. We're going to prepare to play the right way."" The Athletic's Aaron Portzline attempted to ask about the breakdown on the second Leafs goal and, at this point, Tortorella had had enough. “What's your question, Portzy? God damn, you just keep on working me, don't you,"" Tortorella fumed. The scribe shot back, ""I keep asking you questions about playoff hockey games, yeah, sorry."" “Yeah,"" Tortorella responded, ""and I've told you I'm not interested in breaking down what's happened in the games and I've been very fair about that. All I'm telling you is I'm looking to get our team ready to play the next game and I'm sorry I don't have information for your story, but that's how we're going to go about our business.""  ”God damn, you just keep on working me...”  Tight-lipped   head coach John Tortorella maintains that he’s not interested in questions breaking down what happened in the game:    — TSN Hockey (@TSNHockey)  “It's a process,"" Tortorella said. ""He's a young player still learning to understand momentum swings in games, what is needed in certain situations when things aren't going right for him or the team. It doesn't surprise me. It happens with all young players. We've gone through quite a bit of adversity as we've played the past couple of years and I think it's good training ground for some of our young guys."" Dubois, who led the Jackets in scoring in the regular season, has failed to hit the scoresheet through two games. He was on the ice for two goals against on Tuesday night.    — Alison (@AlisonL)  ---  , who played seven seasons with Muzzin in Los Angeles, had never seen his friend stay down like he did on Tuesday night. ""That was the first time I've ever seen him need medical attention on the ice,"" Clifford said. ""Bit of a scary moment, but he's a mentally strong guy. He's a big, tough kid so we're just hoping for a speedy recovery and just go one day at a time."" Clifford appreciated that general manager Kyle Dubas kept the team apprised of Muzzin's status throughout the night. ""I know [Muzzin's wife] Courtney's obviously thinking about it and his mom and dad and everyone wants to be there by his side and we're in a different situation now with COVID,"" Clifford said. ""What I liked is we had a lot of communication. Kyle was with him and he relayed what was going on and kept us all up to date basically on an hourly schedule.""  Muzzin lost feeling in his extremities as a result of the collision, which is why he was taken to hospital. He regained feeling shortly after, however, as the Maple Leafs have acknowledged, he won’t be available for the remainder of the series.  — Darren Dreger (@DarrenDreger)    Leafs forward Kyle Clifford, who was also a teammate of Jake Muzzin's in Los Angeles, discusses the scary injury Muzzin suffered at the end of Game 2 and credits general manager Kyle Dubas for communicating updates on his health to the team. With Muzzin out, Clifford will be the only Leaf suiting up who has won a Stanley Cup. The gritty left winger only played three minutes and 21 seconds in Game 1, but made an early impression in Game 2, levelling Jackets defenceman   with a huge hit. ""It's a short series so we're in an all-in mindset with our team and when our number's called we're just going to be ready to do what provides us with the best opportunity to win the game,"" Clifford said. ""We have enough experience with [Jason] Spezza and I and Pierre [Engvall] or Goater [ ] to be ready."" Clifford played seven minutes and 36 seconds in Game 2, finishing with one shot and two hits.

They flipped the script with goals from Nylander, Tavares and Hyman to tie, and Auston Matthews wins it.   Image description text   TORONTO – To understand what it means to the   that   picked a fight, chucked his gloves and started throwing rights at Dean Kukan’s face with the season looking lost Friday night, you should know a few things. You should know that Spezza, 37, grew up a Leafs fan in this city and that he agreed to skate minimal minutes here for the lowest amount of money the club could legally agree to pay him. You should know that already this week he’s watched some of his ring-chasing contemporaries, like Henrik Lundqvist and Patrick Marleau, get kicked out of the Eastern Conference bubble with, quite literally, no fanfare. And you should know that he has four daughters aged 10 and under: Sophia, Nicola, Anna and Julia. Sometimes he reads them children’s books authored by Zach Hyman. When Spezza kissed his girls goodbye and moved into a hotel so close yet so impenetrably far away in order to play “road” games like Game 4’s 4-3 stunner over Columbus, they understood why their father would be FaceTime-only for two months, best-case scenario. “They know Daddy’s got a dream,” Spezza said. “Trying to win a Stanley Cup as a Maple Leaf is something I dreamed of as a kid.” This isn’t sacrifice. This is choice. This is opportunity, perhaps one last. So, it wasn’t that Spezza got caught up in the emotions of Elimination Night that he fought for just the seventh time in an NHL career that spans 1,207 games. It was that — after watching the Maple Leafs give up six unanswered goals in the series — he was trying to inject some emotions. No way the young guys who affectionately nicknamed him “Vintage” and picked his brain for face-off tips could possibly feel as desperate as the old fourth-liner with no job security for 2020-21. But he could help them come close. “Just trying to spark the guys,” Spezza explained of the five-minute major, which drew a chorus of stick slaps from the bench. “Just trying to show some desperation and have some pushback. Without the crowd, you don’t have that. Just trying to create some emotion and play the role that I’m in. Trying to get everyone going.” Hey, maybe the Maple Leafs’ all-stars wouldn’t have thrown down their historic three-goal, three-minute, goalie-pulled comeback without Spezza’s calculated bit of barbarianism. We’ll never know. We do know the effort of Spezza’s fourth line — which topped all units by generating 78.57 per cent of shot attempts 5-on-5 — made a tangible impact in the most important game of the year. “Jason Spezza just did not want our season to end today. He played with that level of urgency. You see the fight. That’s playoff hockey,” said coach Sheldon Keefe, unprompted.  “That’s a guy not wanting to go down — literally — without a fight.” Hyman, who slammed the tying goal with 22 seconds left in regulation, recently revealed that he and his new bride are going to have a baby this winter. The winger said he wouldn’t hesitate to call “Spezz” in the middle of the night for parenting tips. Seeing that fight meant something to Hyman. Spezza got the boys going. Somehow, with less time on the clock, the group’s belief in a comeback was better in the second intermission than the first. “He wants it more than anybody,” Hyman said. “He was a first-line player throughout his career, an all-star, Hall of Famer — and now he’s playing on the fourth line and he’s willing to drop the gloves and give our team momentum when we’re down. “He’s a real leader on our team, and he’s a huge part of our team. We all love him.”  Spezza hugging Matthews!   — Omar (@TicTacTOmar)  Game 4 was Spezza embracing his new role — critical bit player in the Leafs’ 19-act drama — to an extent that seemed almost impossible in October. To think: Spezza was healthy-scratched on Opening Night against Ottawa because former coach Mike Babcock believed he wasn’t really interested in being a fourth-liner. As Toronto’s roller-coaster season clattered and dipped, Spezza was at risk of being waived due to a salary-cap crunch. Yet some well-spaced forward injuries kept his dream on life support, and a coaching change secured more ice time. Do you believe fate? As Keefe has tinkered with his fourth unit in this series, benching Frederik Gauthier and Pierre Engvall for games, Spezza’s presence has been steady, valued. Spezza has gone out of his way to chat with quiet 18-year-old Nick Robertson, closer to Sophia’s age than his, because he remembers what it’s like being an OHL phenom wedged into an NHL playoff roster and just yearning to belong. This week he’s ditched the game-day suit and tried to embrace the young Leafs’  . Now that he’s found a niche, he doesn’t want to crawl out.     “This is a time when experience really pays off. You can be calm in pressure-packed situations, and I’ve always had good playoff performances,” Spezza said. “This is kind of what you envision — being a piece of a good team and having to be a leader.” What you don’t envision is three straight 6-on-5 goals, an overtime win and being on the fun side of an 0-3 comeback 21 hours after being on the wrong side of one. “I’ve never been a part of anything like that,” said Spezza, 17 years deep. “With the firepower we have with these guys, the way they can put the puck in the net, we’re never out of it. There’s a great sense of belief in our group.”  sorry for the quality but i’m BEGGING you all to watch jason spezza in this clip because it’s amazing   — scrappy kappy (@marnylandersen)  Sophia, Nicola, Anna and Julia couldn’t be there Friday to press their faces to the glass and watch one of the most exhilarating moments of Dad’s career. But the good thing about the bubble? It’s see-through. “They’ll be watching the games a little more eagerly because they know what has gone into it,” Spezza said. “That’s what families are for – you lean on each other in difficult times.”  A close look at Jason Spezza this morning   — GTHL Hockey (@GTHLHockey)                                           You can change your selections at any time.

The Florida Panthers have officially parted ways with Dale Tallon, and there are questions in Toronto about whether or not this is the right offseason to break up the fabulous four.  There were rumors last week after the Florida Panthers were eliminated from the play-ins that Dale Tallon would be parting the organization. That was made official on Monday.  MONTREAL, QC – NOVEMBER 17: Florida Panthers general manager Dale Tallon (Photo by Francois Laplante/FreestylePhoto/Getty Images) The Panthers   that a search for their next GM has begun and in a statement by owner Vinnie Viola, the team said goodbye to Tallon. He said: For the last decade, Dale raised the team’s profile, attracted key players to South Florida and brought character and class to our franchise. When we purchased the Panthers in 2013, we did so with a singular goal–to win a Stanley Cup. We have not seen our efforts come to fruition. We will now begin an organizational search for the next general manager. , Vegas Golden Knights head coach Pete DeBoer revealed that forward Max Pacioretty has arrived “in the bubble,” (out of quarantine) and is expected to be ready to play for Game 1 of their playoff series against the Chicago Blackhawks. Max Pacioretty (  / The Hockey Writers) Pacioretty missed the round-robin series due to an undisclosed injury, but has officially tested negative through four tests which will allow him to practice with the team today. It will be a key addition for the Golden Knights as he scored 32 goals and 66 points in 71 games this season.  It is presumed he will jump back up on the top line.  Minnesota Wild defenseman Ryan Suter   the extent of the injuries that kept him out of the lineup against the Vancouver Canucks. Now that the team is out of the play-ins, he could share that he injured his right foot during Game 3. Unfortunately, this is the same foot he had operated on back in 2018 when he broke his ankle. The good news is, Suter said he should be fine and is going to the doctor tomorrow to get it checked further. In other Wild news,   that Mikko Koivu is not ready to make a decision on his NHL future yet. Russo quotes Koivu who said: “I need to be real careful, especially with that game and what do I want with the future and then go from there,” said Koivu, via The Athletic’s Jessi Pierce. “It’s such a big decision, there’s no way I’m ready to do that right now.” Now that the Toronto Maple Leafs are officially out of the postseason, the questions about whether or not the team should break up the big four — John Tavares, Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander — will begin.  Toronto Maple Leafs right wing Mitchell Marner and Toronto Maple Leafs centre Auston Matthews (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette) : “I do believe in a perfect world Kyle Dubas would give his big 4 one more year…this has been a bit of a strange finish, I think that’s what he would like to do.” That said, he did add that there are major concerns that the team only score three 5v5 goals the entire series. “There’s going to have to be a long conversation whether that still is the plan,” he said.  noted that it might be a little early to make such a big decision given the playoff scenario with the pandemic, but there is also a thought within the organization that it may be riskier to do nothing. The team is already going to be making some tough choices with a tight salary cap and perhaps it’s time to make major changes.  Should the Maple Leafs win the draft lottery tonight, that will change everything in terms of the feeling inside the organization to keep their top four offensive weapons in tact.  TSN Insider Bob McKenzie posted a note on Twitter today thanking fans and saying he’ll be leaving his regular role with the network. He plans to start his semi-retirement after the draft lottery on Monday and will be limited in his role with TSN moving forward.  In part of his statement he wrote: “This isn’t goodbye as much as it is, see you later. As reported earlier, I have a new five-year contract with TSN. I’ll still be kicking around some but not nearly as much.” Thank you. 🙏  — Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie)  McKenzie was one of the best insiders in the business. A well-respected source for information, he’ll be missed. That he’ll still be offering draft rankings and doing big TSN events is a relief for many.

Please read our   first.       					THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette				   I have a simple message for   fans — take a deep breath. After losing Game 1 of their best-of-five   playoff qualifier 2-0 against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday night, many of Toronto’s fans are already getting themselves in position to abandon ship and call it a series.   Now, on one hand, I can’t blame those fans for thinking that way given this team’s playoff stumbles over the last handful of years. But Game 1 at Scotiabank Arena was a virtual toss-up. Scoreless through two periods, both teams had their opportunities to put the puck in the net, but Toronto’s   and Columbus’ Joonas Korpisalo were very good between the pipes, making 33 and 28 saves, respectively.     🗨️ We have to find a way to break them down, get quality looks, second and third opportunities and finish on some of our chances. 🎥 Today's media mashup |    — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Game 2 will be waged on Tuesday night, and the Maple Leafs are expected to show a little bit more determination and come flying out of the gate, so the first 10 minutes of the hockey game will be vitally important for both teams.    That brings me to the key to this series — the first goal of the game. Scoring the first goal is massive for each team because it plays to their strengths and dictates how the rest of the game will flow.   The Leafs and Jackets each won 24 games when scoring first during the 2019-20 regular season, and wouldn’t you know it, each team lost only five times when they opened the scoring in a game.     If Columbus scores first, they can do what they do best, focus on their defence-first mindset and concentrate on shutting down Toronto’s highly skilled top six forwards.   But a first tally for Toronto would force the Blue Jackets to open up their style and potentially expose themselves defensively to a Maple Leafs’ counter-attack. Game 1 offered up a great chess match over the first two periods and the team that scores first Tuesday night may again end up winning.  is the assistant program, news and senior sports director at Global News Radio 900 CHML.

Defenceman Morgan Rielly said Wednesday that while the team supports Minnesota's Matt Dumba, it won't be joining the protest during the anthems.       (Andre Ringuette/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images) Toronto Maple Leafs alternate captain Morgan Rielly says he and his teammates are in Matt Dumba's corner as he protests against racial injustice during the NHL's return to competition. However, that doesn't mean the Maple Leaf players will be raising a fist or taking a knee during the pre-game anthems. ""We've definitely talked about it. And I think that as a group, we agree with what [Dumba] had to say in terms of taking action,"" Rielly said Wednesday. ""I think that can take different forms. ""I think that there's been players on our team that have had conversations with outside people, with each other. We've talked about what we want to do moving forward. And we've talked to players that play on other teams about taking action, about doing certain things. We've chosen to go that way."" Dumba, a defenceman for the Minnesota Wild, has been raising his fist during the Canadian and U.S. anthems before games and said he will continue to do so throughout the post-season. The Regina native, who is half-Filipino, was also the first NHL player to kneel during the restart when he took a knee for the U.S. anthem before Edmonton took on Chicago on Saturday in the first restart game at Rogers Place. He also made a speech at centre ice before the game stressing the need for social and racial justice. Athletes from several professional sports leagues have been using their platform to protest racial and social injustice since the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in May. While the protests in the NHL have not been as widespread as in the NBA or Major League Soccer, some players have demonstrated during the pre-game anthems. Vegas winger Ryan Reaves, Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner and Dallas Stars forwards Jason Dickinson and Tyler Seguin knelt for the U.S. and Canadian anthems before their seeding Monday game at Rogers Place. ""It's time to start doing something, not just let this be a news cycle and forget about it and do it all over again,"" Lehner said after the game. ""Everyone should have the same chance in society, everyone should be treated the same."" The Calgary Flames are counting on Andrew Mangiapane to be a quick study in their brief do-or-die battle with the Winnipeg Jets. The young Flames winger showed a lack of discipline in Game 2 of the best-of-five playoff qualification series when he took an ill-advised retaliation penalty late in the game, cross-checking Jets forward Cody Eakin. Calgary, which was looking for an equalizing goal, instead found itself short-handed for the fifth time in the third period, ultimately stumbling to a 3-2 loss that tied the series 1-1. ""Obviously at the time I wasn't thinking and all that, but it's a 3-2 hockey game there, and you're taking a penalty, putting us on a disadvantage,"" Mangiapane said Wednesday. ""Got to learn from it, obviously, and move on."" ""We talk about there being two pains in life, the pain of discipline and the pain of regret,"" Ward said. ""Often times the pain of regret weighs a lot heavier than the pain of discipline. ""I think for him he took the message the right way. I think he had 95 per cent of it figured out himself already."" While Loui Eriksson has seen his offence dry up since joining Vancouver for the 2016-17 season, he came into the Canucks' best-of-five series with Minnesota as one of the team's few battle-tested playoff performers. He's also been a rock for some of Vancouver's talented but inexperienced core. Canucks coach Travis Green said captain Bo Horvat benefited from having Eriksson on his line. ""I think with Loui, he brings a lot of different things to the game,"" Canucks coach Travis Green said Wednesday. ""I think Bo's line played a lot better last game, and whenever we put Loui there it seems to solidify the line. ""I know if you talk to Bo he enjoys playing with Loui. If Bo's game isn't totally sharp, whenever we put Loui there it seems to help."" Add some “good” to your morning and evening. A variety of newsletters you'll love, delivered straight to you.

They were smothered by the Blue Jackets’ defensive structure while also facing the stellar play of goaltender Joonas Korpisalo. In a short series like this, there is very little time to make the necessary adjustments after a loss. However, the Maple Leafs did that for Game 2. They were able to address their issues, which allowed them to break free from the Blue Jackets’ defensive pressure. Their attention to detail and execution was a big factor and they were noticeably the better team in this game. With a victory under their belt, the Maple Leafs need to shift their focus to Game 3. The Blue Jackets are expected to push back, so they have to find a way to not be complacent and play the way they did in Game 2. Here is what the Maple Leafs need to do in order to repeat their success for Game 3. If there’s one thing that the Maple Leafs did in Game 2 that wasn’t quite evident in Game 1, it was getting into the offensive zone and making Korpisalo work. They were hampered by the Blue Jackets’ pressure style of defense in both the offensive and neutral zone, leaving them very little to work with in terms of generating any type of offense. When they did,   to shut the door. That changed in Game 2. The Maple Leafs were able to learn from the game tape and found a way to penetrate the Blue Jackets’ stifling defense and made them pay for it. While it took five periods for them to finally score a goal, they were flying out of the gate and didn’t ease up on Korpisalo. Good things come to those who are patient. Offensively it was definitely a better performance for the Maple Leafs, generating shots from all over the ice, getting grade-A opportunities, one after another. The team did a better job of getting to the centre of the ice instead of staying stagnant and shooting from the outside. Toronto Maple Leafs and Columbus Blue Jackets Game 1 Heat Map. Image from Natural Stat Trick. Toronto Maple Leafs and Columbus Blue Jackets Game 2 Heat Map. Image from Natural Stat Trick. In all situations, the Maple Leafs did generate chances in front of the net in Game 1. In Game 2, they were more aggressive in that area as it became a hot zone, resulting in two goals. The Maple Leafs held a considerable advantage in terms of Corsi For in all situations, 71-48 with a percentage of 59.66%. They even had the advantage in High Danger Corsi For, 17-8 (68%). The Maple Leafs even limited the Blue Jackets’ shots against to fewer than 10 each period. If the Maple Leafs need any tips on how to beat Korpisalo, it’s get to him early and pummel him with shots. While none of the goals were a result of crowding the crease, there were instances where they were able to get bodies in front of Korpisalo and apply the pressure down low in order to get more of the chances in the high-danger area. If someone is in the right spot at the right time, the goals are bound to start coming. This ties in to the above point, how were they able to get to Korpisalo? The Maple Leafs couldn’t beat the Blue Jackets when they were getting in on the forecheck and had bodies back to not allow anything go through their defense. The trick was they didn’t give the Blue Jackets time and space to even get their forecheck set up. They had bodies back and pressured the opposition, breaking up plays and providing a more physical element that worked in their favour. They kept them to the outside for most of the game while getting the support they needed to make quick transitional breakouts to get by the Blue Jackets’ defense. Toronto Maple Leafs centre Auston Matthews (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette) Both of the Maple Leafs goals by Auston Matthews and John Tavares were a result of the Blue Jackets getting caught in the offensive zone leading to odd-man rushes going the other way. And this is where the Maple Leafs transition game will play a big factor with their speed and skill. On the first goal, Zach Werenski was caught way down low, leaving Oliver Bjorkstrand as the second defender back. The Maple Leafs countered swiftly with bodies going the other way and took advantage of that match-up. Zach Hyman was able to find Matthews in the middle of the ice for a tip, giving the Maple Leafs a 1-0 lead.   A similar situation happened on the second goal. Werenski got a shot down low, but there was no support from the Blue Jackets as all five players were below the face-off circle. The puck came out of the zone and Tavares had a clear breakaway, scoring to make it 2-0. The Maple Leafs did a great job of exposing the Blue Jackets’ weakness and getting in behind their defense with speed, and pursuing the puck with an aggressive nature. They should not stray away from this game plan for Game 3. There’s no doubt that the Blue Jackets are going to push back, but they need to know they can’t be intimidated. They proved that their offense can break apart even one of the best defenses in the league. The Maple Leafs’ power play was lethal during the regular season, ranking sixth overall at 23.1 percent. Through two games, they are 0-for-6. Even though they didn’t score, they showed how lethal they can be  . They found those lanes to Matthews for a big shot, had great puck distribution and their cycle game was on point. Toronto Maple Leafs centre Mitch Marner celebrates with teammate Morgan Rielly (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Thornhill) However, there were times where they couldn’t generate a whole lot. Whether it was due to the Blue Jackets laying the body down to block shots, poor zone entries and even getting caught on a shorthanded odd-man rush. If the Maple Leafs are going to have any success, the power play needs to click and fast.  You’re not going to score on every power play you get, but these are the crucial opportunities to take advantage of. Yes, they generated a lot more on the man advantage than in Game 1, but you need to capitalize on those chances. They can be the difference-maker in a playoff series where it’s a tight checking game like the one they’re already in. The team’s dominant win came with a cost.  When Jake Muzzin lay on the ground after an  , the stretcher was called out and everyone held their breath. Muzzin tried to get up on his own power while talking with the medical staff, but they went with the safe approach and stretchered him off. He was taken to hospital and was alert, which is a really good sign. Tavares even said things were positive. Jake Muzzin, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) Since Muzzin had to leave the bubble,   and test negative four times as a result of the NHL’s Phase 4 protocol. There is some good news as he was discharged from the hospital and is now in quarantine, expected to return when he has recovered. An update on   defenceman Jake Muzzin:  — Leafs PR (@LeafsPR)  There’s no doubt that Muzzin is an essential player for the Maple Leafs as he brings a physical element and earns a lot of minutes. It’s most likely that Martin Marincin (much to fans’ dismay) could enter the lineup or even Rasmus Sandin. No matter who is in, the Maple Leafs need to repeat their Game 2 performance for the rest of the series now that Muzzin is out of the lineup. This is where a team’s true character starts to show, especially when they faced adversity all season. From here on out, everyone needs to step up in his absence. It’s tough to replace a player like him, but the   when he suffered a broken foot and a broken hand. While it was hard, the Maple Leafs pulled through and they’re going to have to do it again.

But they’ll  really  be back on Sunday night, when their best-of-five qualifying round series kicks off against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Entering that series, here are four questions the Maple Leafs are facing. The 2019-20 season has been a tumultuous one for Maple Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen from a performance perspective (career-low .909 save percentage and 2.85 goals against average). Still, the workload hasn’t wavered. Sportsnet’s Luke Fox   that since 2016, when Toronto acquired Andersen, the goalie has faced 7,748 shots and stopped 7,142 of them — both NHL highs by roughly 300. Andersen has made the most starts (244) in that span as well. Patience doesn’t last forever, but Andersen has built enough trust with Toronto to retain his spot entering the playoffs. Keep in mind that he has been the only Maple Leaf in the crease during their past three playoff runs. His backup, Jack Campbell, has zero NHL playoff experience. In the best-of-five series at least, it’ll likely stay that way. Revealed: FC Barcelona’s Champions League Plan To Nullify High-Scoring Bayern Munich And Advance Donald Trump Criticizing Player Protests Appears To Have Little Impact On NFL, NBA Ratings Serena, Venus Williams Both Win In Return To Court To Set Up Showdown In Kentucky Mikheyev needed all of 33 seconds on Tuesday to respond to that question. Can you believe this was Mikheyev’s first competitive shift since December? Not too shabby. During Toronto’s recent training camp, coach Sheldon Keefe   the 25-year-old rookie had “a little extra jump,” which is impressive given that he was already among the fastest skaters on the team. Mikheyev was also named the MVP of the Maple Leafs’ camp and looks primed to skate on a line with John Tavares. For a guy who skated almost entirely with the team’s bottom-six in the winter, that’s huge. Now we’ll get to see how real Mikheyev’s per 60 stats are, which rank among the best on the team (at 5-on-5): Seriously, quiz your friend on who leads the Maple Leafs in even-strength points per 60. I’m certain they won’t pick Mikheyev.  If he can drive offense like this, Toronto will somehow be an even scarier scoring machine. Aside from not having to travel to the hub city ... pretty much nothing! We know there won’t be fans, but the league’s efforts to level the playing field goes further than that. Toronto will serve as the home team for some games at Scotiabank Arena (the first two, and the fifth if necessary against Columbus), but they’ll have to be the road team as well. That means relinquishing their own dressing room, as they did Tuesday for the Canadiens. The NHL has put up generic signage in the rink, too, and home teams will get some creature comforts like goal songs, win songs, hype videos, etc. Off the ice, the Maple Leafs are still required to quarantine in a hotel just like everybody else. They are one of seven Eastern Conference teams staying at the Fairmont Royal York in downtown Toronto, while five teams are at Hotel X just west of downtown. Royal York is closer to the rink, but Hotel X is actually the more modern facility, with a rooftop pool, tennis courts and immediate access to BMO Field (which Sportsnet’s Chris Johnston   will be accessible to players who want to grill, work out or just relax).  So even in their own city, the Maple Leafs don’t have the optimal place to stay. OK, we don’t really have the answer for this one. They certainly  can  beat Columbus, but the results will have to play themselves out in the next week or two. For what it’s worth, Toronto is 3-1-1 against Columbus in the past two years, including 1-0-1 this year. By  As I examined two months ago, this matchup can be simplified as offense (Toronto) vs. defense (Columbus). There are always more layers than that, but you get the basic picture. And hey, it might even be fun! The most pressing question to ask is probably whether or not the NHL can survive through to the end of this season. We certainly hope the answer is a resounding yes.

You can read Katya’s article on the reasoning behind the move.  “The KHL season is set to start On September 2, with training camp already underway, but the official schedule has not been released. Training camps have been disrupted with multiple positive tests for COVID-19, cancelled games and tournaments amidst a plan that seems to involve regular operation, international travel and fans in arenas for games where that is allowed.”     Related   Korshkov is the second Leaf heading to Russia to start the season early, the other being recent signee  , who is back with Jokerit.

All the focus seems to be on the team’s top offensive threats heading into the postseason, and rightfully so. Of the six players to score double-digit goals, five scored 15 or more during the regular season, all of whom are in their top-six forward group. The Maple Leafs’ secondary scoring and contributions from the bottom-six forwards proved that they can be key factors during the regular season. The Leafs could’ve had more goal scorers with double-digits, if weren’t for players missing time with injuries as well as late-season call-ups. Alexander Kerfoot and Jason Spezza had nine and Ilya Mikheyev, Andreas Johnsson (both missed significant time with injuries) and Pierre Engvall had eight. They could’ve had an additional five goal scorers in that category. Toronto Maple Leafs right wing Ilya Mikheyev, centre Alexander Kerfoot, defenceman Morgan Rielly and defenceman Rasmus Sandin celebrate a goal. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov) The Maple Leafs have the scoring depth, and many players that have been underrated all season could prove to be key factors that can attribute to the team’s success. During the training camp and exhibition game against the Montreal Canadiens, multiple players have elevated their play and caught the eye of many, especially the coaching staff. Here are three Maple Leaf players that could fly under the radar during the postseason. It didn’t take long for Mikheyev to get comfortable in North America. He recorded six points in eight games and only got better as the season progressed. During what seemed like an impressive rookie season, he eventually hit a bump in the road after   that kept him out of the lineup for three months. When the season was paused, many players needed the added time to heal up, and Mikheyev was one of those that benefited. It seemed to have worked. He came to camp   than ever. He seems to be on another level than he was before he sustained his injury. Ilya Mikheyev, Toronto Maple Leafs (  / The Hockey Writers) It’s a small sample, but Mikheyev was one of the major standouts during the Maple Leafs training camp. Being placed on a line with John Tavares and Mitch Marner, there seemed to be another gear in his game that was untapped before. He’s putting forth the effort and keeping up with the two as the line had immediate chemistry. While he performed well starting off in a third-line role, Mikheyev exceeded those expectations. He was given the opportunity to be an essential factor in a more prominent role for the Maple Leafs and he hasn’t taken it for granted. He   during one of the team’s scrimmages and went further scoring the first goal of their game against the Canadiens in only 33 seconds. Mikheyev has flown under the radar all season considering his contributions. His 23 points had him ranked 13 th  among rookie skaters and was averaging 0.59 points per game. He also had a strong Corsi-for percentage when he was on the ice, at 53.48. He even found time on the penalty kill, averaging 1:55 of ice time per game. Already with great numbers, they could’ve been higher if he didn’t suffer a serious injury. The fact that he’s moved higher in the lineup shows that head coach Sheldon Keefe has faith in Mikheyev’s ability to be an impactful player in a more prominent role. If he can continue to produce and be effective in a top-six role like we’ve seen so far, then Mikheyev’s contributions will help the Maple Leafs in the postseason. When the Maple Leafs acquired Kerfoot in the blockbuster deal that also saw Tyson Barrie come over in the Nazem Kadri deal, Kerfoot was going to be a different player than Kadri.  Fans weren’t going to see the same tenacious, in-your-face style that Kadri played. They were getting a more refined, defensive style that would benefit the team. After recording back-to-back 40-point seasons with the Colorado Avalanche, Kerfoot seemed to have taken a step back and  . A rough season is an understatement – a new system, new coach, new environment, a coaching change, switching from centre to wing, and facial surgery. That’s a lot to go through in your first season with a new team. From what we saw when the Maple Leafs returned, Kerfoot was one of those players that seemed to have regained his confidence and was more comfortable with his play. This couldn’t have come a better time for the third line centre.  Alexander Kerfoot, Toronto Maple Leafs ( /The Hockey Writers) THW’s own Adam Reid came out with a great article on the Maple Leafs  . Reid talks about how more engaged Kerfoot was in all three zones and how a player like him could make a big impact during the postseason. Kerfoot was by far the best the forward on the ice for the Maple Leafs against the Canadiens and his line with Nick Robertson and Kasperi Kapanen was absolutely dominant throughout the game. Kerfoot recorded two goals, one being short-handed and the other tipping in Morgan Rielly’s point shot. He was a workhorse all over the ice, going into the corners and battling in front of the net, while showing his defensive capabilities in his own end and on the penalty kill. This is the type of play that Kerfoot wanted to have on a consistent basis all season. He has the ability to do the little things on the ice right. Plays like that are underappreciated, but they become extremely important in the playoffs. That is where Kerfoot can be even more valuable to his team’s success. I was originally going to pick Nick Robertson in this space. He quickly   during camp and didn’t look out of place at all in his first pro game. But, in this case, the veteran who has had a successful career is too important to not mention. Spezza, the oldest member of the team, doesn’t get as much credit as he deserves. While his days as a top offensive producer are behind him, he’s still capable of playing really well and being a complementary piece in a depth role. Being on a team as young as the Maple Leafs, Spezza is still relied on to be a voice in the dressing room.  At 37 years old, time isn’t on Spezza’s side in hopes of winning a Stanley Cup. A deep run with the Maple Leafs   to the veteran of 17 seasons. The closest he came was back in 2006-07 when his Ottawa Senators fell short to the Anaheim Ducks in the Cup Final. During that run, Spezza posted 7 goals and 15 assists. Throughout his career, he’s recorded 70 points in 80 playoff games. That experience and production speak volumes to Spezza’s attitude, determination, and the impact he can have with the Maple Leafs during this run. Toronto Maple Leafs forward Jason Spezza (THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Jeffrey T. Barnes) From everything that he’s endured this season, including a possible  , you can bet that Spezza is going to be hungry and motivated this time around. He still has a great shot, recording nine goals this season. His 56.52 high-danger goals-for percentage ranks second on the team to Auston Matthews with a minimum of 500 minutes played. Even though he’s in a depth role, Spezza can still be an important factor for the Maple Leafs offense by jumping into the play every now and then. Depth players always seem to step up during the playoffs. Spezza can be that player who can rise to the occasion and be an important piece to the Maple Leafs’ success. Aside from their “go-to” players, the Maple Leafs have many others that can make significant contributions during the postseason. A team with depth always finds success in the playoffs, and Toronto has an abundance of it where they can go above and beyond.   start:tags     end:tags    start:article footer     end:article footer         Ezoic - BottomNative - native_bottom    placeholder 111 blocked.

I feel like I've got more to offer and it's a good chance for me to show it,” Barrie said on a Zoom call from the NHL’s Eastern Conference Hub at the Royal York Hotel on Thursday.   “I feel pretty comfortable right now with my game, all things considered. It'll be a bit of a bizarre [thing] to jump right into playoffs after so much time off but it's a good opportunity to kind of make up for a bit of an up-and-down season.”   The 29-year-old blueliner and forward   were dealt to Toronto on July 1, 2019, in exchange for centre   and defenceman  . Expectations immediately soared over how Barrie’s offensive skill set would help improve the Leafs’ beleaguered blueline, and as an impending unrestricted free agent, it was in Barrie’s best interest to impress.   That proved to be difficult from the get-go. Former Leafs’ head coach Mike Babcock didn’t give Barrie the same top-unit power-play time he was accustomed to in Colorado and Barrie’s confidence seemed to sag as a result.   In the 22 games before Babcock was fired and replaced by Sheldon Keefe, Barrie amassed zero goals and six assists, a far cry from his scoring pace the previous two seasons, where he finished with 57 and 59 points respectively.   When Keefe took over, Barrie moved onto the Leafs’ first power-play group and his offensive output increased. But the rest of the campaign was still an inconsistent affair, and Barrie finished with just 39 points (five goals, 34 assists) in 70 games.   Returning to his native British Columbia during the NHL’s pause, Barrie regrouped mentally and physically, the results of which have been apparent since he came back - in somewhat delayed fashion - to the Leafs’ facilities.   “I think he's been good. We've been impressed with him really since he arrived here,” said Keefe. “He was one of our late arrivals into Phase 2 [voluntary workouts]. I think he was probably our last regular player to arrive. We were anxious to see what Tyson was going to be like when he arrived and where he was at – from his conditioning and the skill work and everything like that. But he put in a lot of good work back home himself and it was very clear that he wasn't behind in any way. That was very positive for us to see and there's been a lot of encouraging signs here that he's ready to go.”​   Toronto has already played its one and only exhibition game before kicking off a best-of-five qualifying-round series against Columbus on Aug. 2, so Keefe’s main focus now is on making sure the Leafs’ preparedness stays at an all-time high.   That may well include mandatory viewing of the Blue Jackets’ preseason game against Boston on Thursday night.   “We'll definitely have it on, we'll be watching,” Barrie said. “But I think our coaches have had so much time to prepare, they’re going to hammer us with all the video and clips that we can handle. We've been watching a bunch and I'm sure there's lots more to come before we face off on Sunday.”   Keefe’s mid-season promotion behind Toronto’s bench didn’t allow for much system tweaking during the regular season, and he's made up for lost time during Phase 3’s training camp by trying to impart his brand of hockey upon the Leafs.   “I would define [a Sheldon Keefe team] as one that values the puck when they have it, and takes care of it and plays with purpose when they have it and are really committed to getting it back as quickly as possible through our pressure and defensive habits,” Keefe explained.   “There's a heightened awareness in everything you're doing [now]. So my expectation is that we'll pick up [systems] quicker than normal. We're not going to make any excuses here; we've had plenty of time to practise and we're expecting our guys to be prepared to execute.”   Implementing what's asked of them hasn't been Toronto's greatest strength this season, though. Not unlike Barrie, the Leafs struggled to find a good rhythm in the regular season and that hurt their collective confidence.   Toronto's hope is that those issues are far behind them now. But there’s only one way to know for sure.   “We've really worked hard here to clean up a lot of things in our game,” Keefe said. “And we're looking for greater consistency within that. Whether we're proving ourselves right, or proving others wrong, you can create that narrative any way you wish. We're just going to go out and perform.”	    		                       ",2020-07-30 00:00:00

You'll have to wing it a little bit."" Tavares isn't really the 'wing it' kind of guy. He's all about preparation and details and being ready. But playing professional hockey in a pandemic is going to be unlike anything anyone has seen before.  ""You'll have to continue to adapt and expect the unpredictable and just be able to deal with it,"" said Tavares, who will turn 30 in September. ""If there are certain games that go into overtimes and push the start times later that's something you've never dealt with before, so there's a possibility for a lot of different things. You just have be very open-minded and adjust on the fly and deal with those circumstances."" The Leafs didn't always handle adversity well during a roller-coaster regular season that saw Mike Babcock fired, injuries to key players and generally inconsistent play.  ""We have to deal with the momentum swings that you see in playoff series better than we handled some things in the regular season,"" Tavares admitted.   Finish Phase 3 strong ðŸ’ª    â€” Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  In uncertain times, Tavares believes his teammates understand the opportunity at hand.  ""Pandemic's given [us] perspective on a lot of different things,"" he said. ""We know what a lot of people are going through, what the world's going through, society, and to be able to do this, have a chance to complete this season, continue to compete and chase the Stanley Cup, there's nothing better than that."" The Leafs players will report to the practice facility on Sunday morning to undergo COVID-19 testing, but then they will have the afternoon off to spend with family and make final preparations for what they hope will be the longest and strangest road trip of their lives. The team will re-assemble at night and take a bus to the Fairmont Royal York.  Sheldon Keefe, like Tavares, wasn't packed as of Saturday afternoon.  ""My wife has helped to really set aside a lot of things for me to be able to choose from,"" Keefe revealed with a smile. ""It's going to be a challenge for me to not overpack and keep it simple and make sure I've got the things I need. I do tend to overpack for a lot of road trips just to give myself options but I want to stay a little bit lighter in this case and not over think it."" It's easy to overthink things these days and so Keefe's message to the team echoes that of his captain.  ""Expect the unexpected and be comfortable being uncomfortable,"" said Keefe, who will turn 40 in September. ""That's a big part of it here. We just have to take things as they come, not complain, just keep our head down and continue to work and be as prepared as possible, as focused as possible for the challenge ahead ... We've put in the work here over the last couple of weeks â€“ and even further back if you look at Phase 2 â€“ to be as prepared as we can be for the physical demands of what's to come. The mental part of it now, we've just got to remain focused on what we can control."" From espresso machines to video game consoles and plenty of underwear, NHLers tell Mark Masters what their 'must haves' are to bring inside the NHL's bubble. --- One wonders what is going through the head of Nick Robertson, who has never played an NHL game, but once again found himself skating on Torontoâ€™s third line at Saturdayâ€™s practice. Afterwards, Keefe laid out a litmus test the 18-year-old must pass in Tuesday's lone exhibition game if the Peterborough Pete hopes to crack the Game 1 lineup.  ""He needs to look comfortable,"" Keefe said. ""He needs to make an impact on the game, be it through his work ethic and enthusiasm or his ability to create some offence and capitalize when he gets chances. All those kinds of things. Really looking to see, can he look like himself and be able to play what I suspect is going [to be] the highest level, highest calibre of game that he's played in? ... Weâ€™re just really looking to see if he can be comfortable and be himself and then see how it all sorts itself out in terms our other players."" The other players battling for that last forward spot appear to be   and  . At Saturday's practice, Engvall skated between   and   on the fourth line while Gauthier was the 13th forward.  â€œWe're just trying to keep all our options open,"" Keefe said. ""So between Engvall and Spezza we wanted to get them some reps at centre ice and playing low in the defensive zone and those types of responsibilities that come with it. We want to remain as flexible as possible and remain as prepared as possible for any decision that we might make.""  Leafs Ice Chips: Robertson's challenge is clear.  has MORE:    â€” TSN (@TSN_Sports)  ---  is getting ready for the playoffs and also to be a dad.   ""Unfortunately, I've got a baby coming,"" the winger said of his imminent departure. ""I'm lucky that the baby's due in December. Some guys, theyâ€™re leaving young kids and expecting mothers during the time we're away. But we're going out there and doing what we love. Everybody going in the bubble understands. You make sure your family is taken care of while youâ€™re away."" Hyman's wife, Alannah, will move in with his family during the playoffs, which gives the 28-year-old some peace of mind.   The stringent safety rules in Phase 4 mean teams will mostly be spending time amongst themselves, especially early on, and Hyman may end up picking the brain of some of the dads on the Leafs, including Tavares, Spezza, Clifford and  . Who's at the top of the list when it comes to asking for advice?  ""Come on, Spezz! He's got four of them so he knows what he's doing,"" Hyman said with a chuckle. ""I'm sure I'll be asking him for lots of advice.""  A detailed look at the NHL's safe zones and arenas for the Return to Play format. ðŸ‘€  MORE @    â€” BarDown (@BarDown)  --- Keefe has made it clear how valuable Toronto's one exhibition game will be in terms of both evaluating players and also how much progress the team has made when it comes to incorporating system tweaks, especially on the defensive side of things.  There are plenty of other questions that need to be answered as well.  ""One of them is the conditioning level of our group and seeing how we get through that in a game environment and playing three full periods, stop time,"" Keefe said. ""I've got to manage that ... I want to try to make sure I get them the appropriate minutes to prepare them for what's to come but, of course, not overdoing it and putting them in bad spots so thatâ€™s a challenge."" The Leafs held six scrimmages during Phase 3, but only once (Sunday July 19) did they play a full 60 minutes.   How intense will Tuesday's exhibition game against Montreal be?  ""You treat it like a real game, because that's the only way you can get prepared,"" said Hyman. ""I think all these exhibition games will be pretty intense and up tempo and I don't think anyone will be holding back.""  isn't as certain.   ""It will be competitive,"" the defenceman said. ""I'm not sure if guys will be really throwing the body. You don't want to lose a guy going into the meaningful games, but I'm sure it'll have a good pace to it. It'll be fast, if anything. I'm not sure if you'll see the typical dump and run guys over kind of thing that you might see in Game 1 of the play-in, but it will be good to get a game in and see what it's like with no fans and have the arena set-up, because it might be a bit odd.""  So, what exactly happened these last two weeks? Glad you asked.  Itâ€™s the return of   Training Camp Takeaways, presented for the first time ever in late July.  This is - dare I say - unprecedented:  â€” Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)  --- The exhibition game will be a key test for Toronto's power play, which struggled to convert down the stretch. Despite the four-month pause, assistant coach Paul McFarland hasn't made any big changes to the system or personnel.  ""The same idea,"" Barrie said of the unit's marching orders. ""We have the same crew."" How are things feeling so far?  ""You never get the full feel for it until you're in an actual game,"" Barrie said. ""We won't know until we get it going."" After the coaching change, Torontoâ€™s power play took off connecting on 27 of 86 chances (31.4 per cent) and leading the league from mid-November to early February. But from Feb. 8 to the end of the regular season, the Leafs connected on just six of 41 power-play chances (14.6 per cent), which ranked 26th in the NHL in that stretch.  ""When we were really going well it was just simple,"" said Barrie, who has retained his job as quarterback of the top unit. ""We were moving the puck quickly and shooting when we should and not over-complicating things. You can see [things work well] when we shoot and thereâ€™s a rebound and something special will happen off that either Mitch [Marner] finds someone backdoor or William [Nylander] or whoever would find the open guy. I think that's when we're at our best, when we're firing the puck and making plays off the rebounds and retrievals."" -- Forwards Nylander - Matthews - Hyman  Mikheyev - Tavares - Marner Robertson - Kerfoot - Kapanen  Clifford - Engvall / Spezza Gauthier  Defence Rielly - Ceci  Muzzin - Holl Dermott - Barrie  Sandin - Marincin  Goalies Andersen  Campbell PP1 Barrie  Marner - Tavares - Matthews  Nylander  PP2 Rielly  Kapanen - Kerfoot - Spezza Hyman            ",2020-07-25 00:00:00

While some of his teammates expressed trepidation at having to pack for Sunday's trip into the National Hockey League Phase 4 Secure Zone,   is unfazed. ""Yeah, I mean, you just got to pack your stuff and go in,"" the forward said nonchalantly. ""I don't think it's that big of a deal. Will be ready to go when the time comes."" The Leafs are hoping this will be a long trip lasting all the way into late September and possibly early October when the Stanley Cup is handed out in Edmonton. The first step is checking into Toronto's Royal York Hotel this weekend. ""Just bring the stuff that I would usually bring,"" Nylander said of his approach. ""Obviously a lot more stuff, but I think it will be pretty simple."" Often listed by teammates as one of the most fashionable Leafs, Nylander insists he hasn't given much thought to the lack of a dress code for games this summer.  ""I'm not too worried about that,"" he said. ""We're getting ready to play important games."" Nylander rarely gets rattled, which made last year's rough ride – seven goals in 54 games – following a prolonged contract stalemate so jarring. But the Swede bounced back in a big way during the 2019-20 regular season scoring 31 goals in 68 games. And, based on what we’ve seen so far at training camp, he's still feeling it. ""Willie is Willie,"" observed linemate  . ""It looks like he picked up where he left off when the season went on pause. He's skating well. He's got his long hair flowing in the wind when he's skating up and down the ice. He's playing with confidence and that's always a good sign when it comes to him.""  That   &   connection 👀   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Nylander, by the way, didn't get a haircut during the entire regular season or throughout the pandemic pause. It wasn't about superstition or style, for that matter. ""Lazy to go cut it,"" he explained with a grin. ​ ""He looks like a real Swede now,"" said good pal   a few days ago. Although Nylander did get a trim early in training camp.  ""I've cut it now for the remainder of the bubble time,"" the 24-year-old said. Nylander looks and sounds like a guy ready to roll. ""I feel pretty great,"" he said. ""We want to get back into playing real games, which will be soon. That will tell how the off-season has been going."" Sheldon Keefe has moved Nylander around at camp, playing him with centres   and  . He even had Nylander at centre on a line with Ilya Mikheyev and   in one scrimmage. The head coach hasn't noticed Nylander play much differently regardless of the spot. ""When Willie's at his best he's able to complement others but also help drive and make others better,"" Keefe noted. ""I like him in any of those situations and I'd say, similarly, even if he plays outside of those guys he's able to do things well. Will's capable of adapting and adjusting to his linemates, but also helping to make them better."" Nylander says his goal is to be ""dominant"" in the playoffs and prove himself on the big stage. Thursday’s scrimmage, which saw his line go up against the Tavares line, was another positive step forward. ""We were able to make it more game-like,"" Nylander noted. ""Obviously, it's hard when you're practising and scrimmaging to keep everything game-like, but today was pretty good. We had a tough start to the game, but we got going as the game went on. That's what we needed to have, because we'll be playing against the best guys on Columbus.""  From  : What a difference a year makes.    discusses how he wants to carry his regular season success this year into the play-in round after a forgettable 2018-19 campaign -    — TSN Hockey (@TSNHockey)  --- Thursday’s scrimmage consisted of two 20-minute, stop-time periods and started at 4 p.m., which is when Game 2 against the Jackets will be played. The players wore game sweaters and there was a full intermission and ice resurfacing after the first period as well as 'television timeout’ breaks in the regular spots. With Team Matthews clinching its scrimmage series against Team   on Wednesday, the groups were shuffled. For the first time, the two top lines went head-to-head with Mikheyev, Tavares and Mitch Marner getting the better of Nylander, Matthews and  . Mikheyev scored a hat trick and added two assists in the 6-3 win for Team Blue. ""He was excellent,"" said Keefe. ""He probably, more so than anybody, is really excited and happy to be back here playing in a team environment. It's been a long road for him to get back to playing in game action. He had a little extra jump all throughout this and that was really great to see. I thought today was his best day as well.""  Hats off to Souperman 🧢🧢🧢   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  Mikheyev has been sidelined since a skate blade lacerated his right wrist on Dec. 27 leading to surgery to repair an artery and tendons. The assembled media at the Ford Performance Centre were asked to vote for the team's Phase 3 most valuable player and Mikheyev came out on top. It wasn't just a sentimental pick. ""He looks good,"" said Matthews. ""He looks really, really good. He's taken a lot of steps, obviously, with that pretty gruesome injury he had. He really worked hard to get back into game shape, skating all this time since the season went on pause so he's looked really good and I think he'll be a great asset for our team."" Mikheyev looked comfortable while playing alongside Tavares and Marner early in the season picking up 23 points in 39 games. After fellow left winger   joined Mikheyev on the long term injured list in February, the Leafs struggled to fill the void in the top six. Johnsson is still out after undergoing knee surgery in February so getting Mikheyev back and up to top-six speed is crucial. ""He and his line I thought were really good,"" said Keefe. ""They were playing with lots of pace and making lots of plays and seemed to have great chemistry throughout so that was a really good piece. It obviously means a lot to our team. It was a big hole in our lineup when he left. He and   both, at the same time, to leave the lineup were big holes and to have one of them back here is a great boost for us.""  *chef's kiss*   — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs)  --- After spending the last couple practices and scrimmages on a line with Alex Kerfoot and Kapanen, Nick Robertson got a look on Toronto’s fourth unit in Thursday’s simulated game skating alongside   and  . “He's a focused individual,"" said Clifford. ""You can tell he wants to be here and be a part of what we're building and I really like his game. He has a really good shot and he's tenacious on the forecheck. There's no give-up in his game. It was fun to play with him today."" Keefe remains undecided about whether the 18-year-old will make his NHL debut in Game 1 against Columbus. ""The exhibition game will really help us refine things a little bit,"" Keefe said. ""I’ve really liked the progression that he’s shown. There are other things at play here, of course there’s his play, his development through all this and then there's also decisions to make on the other players who've played for us up until the pause. Then making a decision based on all those factors on what's going to help us best prepare to win Game 1.""  returned to his usual spot alongside Kerfoot and Kapanen in Thursday’s scrimmage, picking up a goal.   ended up on a Marlies line with   and  ​. The Leafs will play their lone exhibition game on Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens.  The possibility that Nick Robertson will make his   debut in the playoffs is getting more and more real with every passing day at Maple Leafs training camp.  More from  :    — TSN Hockey (@TSNHockey)  --- Keefe singled out Kapanen for making the most progress in the last few days of camp. ""Kappy would be the one who stood out to me in that area,"" Keefe said. ""If I look at his progression through the first three days of camp ... Kappy has really raised his level. The way that he's played the game in terms of using his speed, getting on the puck just having second and third efforts on the puck, those are the kind of things we need to see from him. He's a real difference maker for us when he does that and I've been happy to see that, it’s a real positive sign for us."" On Wednesday, Kapanen credited Clifford for inspiring him and bringing out the feisty side of his game, which is a key ingredient in his success. The pair formed a fast friendship since Clifford was acquired in a February trade with the Kings. ""He's a guy that probably doesn't get all the credit that he deserves just because of the amount of stars we have here,” Clifford said, ""but I think he's a tremendous player and when we have team success is when Kappy's at his best.""  🔥 'SMASH BROS' 💪  Kapanen on  : ""When you see a guy play hard & fight every now & then it fires me up for sure so it's been a positive impact for me""  Mitch Marner on Kasperi: ""He's got a fire under him"" — Mark Masters (@markhmasters)  --- TEAM BLUE   Mikheyev (3), Tavares, Marner (EN), Spezza (EN) Mikheyev - Tavares - Marner Clifford - Spezza - Robertson Petan - Gauthier - Korshkov Muzzin - Holl Sandin - Marincin Kivihalme - Hollowell Campbell TEAM WHITE   Matthews, Engvall, Malgin Nylander - Matthews -Nylander Engvall - Kerfoot - Kapanen Agostino - Brooks - Malgin Rielly - Ceci Dermott - Barrie Rosen - Gaudet Andersen           ",2020-07-23 00:00:00
